.. _release-5.0.0:

5.0.0
-----

This is the first major release of the Jupyter Notebook since version 4.0 was
created by the "Big Split" of IPython and Jupyter.

We encourage users to start trying JupyterLab in preparation for a future
transition.

We have merged more than 300 pull requests since 4.0. Some of the
major user-facing changes are described here.

File sorting in the dashboard
*****************************

Files in the dashboard may now be sorted by last modified date or name (:ghpull:`943`):

.. image:: /_static/images/dashboard-sort.png
   :align: center 

Cell tags
*********

There is a new cell toolbar for adding *cell tags* (:ghpull:`2048`):

.. image:: /_static/images/cell-tags-toolbar.png
   :align: center

Cell tags are a lightweight way to customise the behaviour of tools working with
notebooks; we're working on building support for them into tools like `nbconvert
<https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and `nbval
<https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval>`__. To start using tags,
select ``Tags`` in the ``View > Cell Toolbar`` menu in a notebook.

The UI for editing cell tags is basic for now; we hope to improve it in future
releases.

Table style
***********

The default styling for tables in the notebook has been updated (:ghpull:`1776`).

Before:

.. image:: /_static/images/table-style-before.png
   :align: center
   
After:

.. image:: /_static/images/table-style-after.png
  :align: center

Customise keyboard shortcuts
****************************

You can now edit keyboard shortcuts for *Command Mode* within the UI
(:ghpull:`1347`):

.. image:: /_static/images/shortcut-editor.png
   :align: center

See the ``Help > Edit Keyboard Shortcuts`` menu item and follow the instructions.

Other additions
***************

- You can copy and paste cells between notebooks, using :kbd:`Ctrl-C` and
  :kbd:`Ctrl-V` (:kbd:`Cmd-C` and :kbd:`Cmd-V` on Mac).

- It's easier to configure a password for the notebook with the new
  ``jupyter notebook password`` command (:ghpull:`2007`).

- The file list can now be ordered by *last modified* or by *name*
  (:ghpull:`943`).

- Markdown cells now support attachments. Simply drag and drop an image from
  your desktop to a markdown cell to add it. Unlike relative links that you
  enter manually, attachments are embedded in the notebook itself. An
  unreferenced attachment will be automatically scrubbed from the notebook on
  save (:ghpull:`621`).

- Undoing cell deletion now supports undeleting multiple cells. Cells may not be
  in the same order as before their deletion, depending on the actions you did
  on the meantime, but this should should help reduce the impact of
  accidentally deleting code.

- The file browser now has *Edit* and *View* buttons.

- The file browser now supports moving multiple files at once
  (:ghpull:`1088`).

- The Notebook will refuse to run as root unless the ``--allow-root`` flag is
  given (:ghpull:`1115`).

- Keyboard shortcuts are now declarative (:ghpull:`1234`).

- Toggling line numbers can now affect all cells (:ghpull:`1312`).

- Add more visible *Trusted* and *Untrusted* notifications (:ghpull:`1658`).

- The favicon (browser shortcut icon) now changes to indicate when the kernel is busy
  (:ghpull:`1837`).
  
- Header and toolbar visibility is now persisted in nbconfig and across sessions
  (:ghpull:`1769`).

- Load server extensions with ConfigManager so that merge happens recursively,
  unlike normal config values, to make it load more consistently with frontend
  extensions(:ghpull:`2108`).

- The notebook server now supports the `bundler API
  <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/bundler_extensions.html>`__
  from the `jupyter_cms incubator project
  <https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/contentmanagement>`__ (:ghpull:`1579`).

- The notebook server now provides information about kernel activity in
  its kernel resource API (:ghpull:`1827`).

Remember that upgrading ``notebook`` only affects the user
interface. Upgrading kernels and libraries may also provide new features,
better stability and integration with the notebook interface.

.. _release-4.4.0:

4.4.0
-----

- Allow override of output callbacks to redirect output messages. This is used to implement the ipywidgets Output widget, for example.
- Fix an async bug in message handling by allowing comm message handlers to return a promise which halts message processing until the promise resolves.

.. _release-4.3.1:

4.3.1
-----

4.3.1 is a patch release with a security patch, a couple bug fixes, and improvements to the newly-released token authentication.

**Security fix**:

- CVE-2016-9971. Fix CSRF vulnerability,
  where malicious forms could create untitled files and start kernels
  (no remote execution or modification of existing files)
  for users of certain browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer / Edge).
  All previous notebook releases are affected.

.. _release-4.3:

4.3.0
-----

4.3 is a minor release with many bug fixes and improvements.
The biggest user-facing change is the addition of token authentication,
which is enabled by default.
A token is generated and used when your browser is opened automatically,
so you shouldn't have to enter anything in the default circumstances.
If you see a login page
(e.g. by switching browsers, or launching on a new port with ``--no-browser``),
you get a login URL with the token from the command ``jupyter notebook list``,
which you can paste into your browser.


Highlights:

- API for creating mime-type based renderer extensions using :code:`OutputArea.register_mime_type` and :code:`Notebook.render_cell_output` methods. See `mimerender-cookiecutter <https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter>`__ for reference implementations and cookiecutter.
- Enable token authentication by default. See :ref:`server_security` for more details.
- Update security docs to reflect new signature system
- Switched from term.js to xterm.js

Bug fixes:

- Ensure variable is set if exc_info is falsey
- Catch and log handler exceptions in :code:`events.trigger`
- Add debug log for static file paths
- Don't check origin on token-authenticated requests
- Remove leftover print statement
- Fix highlighting of Python code blocks
- :code:`json_errors` should be outermost decorator on API handlers
- Fix remove old nbserver info files
- Fix notebook mime type on download links
- Fix carriage symbol bahvior
- Fix terminal styles
- Update dead links in docs
- If kernel is broken, start a new session
- Include cross-origin check when allowing login URL redirects

Other improvements:

- Allow JSON output data with mime type ``application/*+json``
- Allow kernelspecs to have spaces in them for backward compat
- Allow websocket connections from scripts
- Allow :code:`None` for post_save_hook
- Upgrade CodeMirror to 5.21
- Upgrade xterm to 2.1.0
- Docs for using comms
- Set :code:`dirty` flag when output arrives
- Set :code:`ws-url` data attribute when accessing a notebook terminal
- Add base aliases for nbextensions
- Include :code:`@` operator in CodeMirror IPython mode
