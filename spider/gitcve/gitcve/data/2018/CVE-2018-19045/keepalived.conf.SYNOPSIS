This file describe all the Keepalived available keywords. The keepalived.conf
file is compounded by three configurations parts :

    * Globals configurations
    * VRRP configuration
    * LVS configuration
    * BFD configuration

0. Comment string

There is 2 valid comment valid string : # or ! If you want to add comment
in you configuration file use this char.

0.1. Parameter syntax

<BOOL> is one of on|off|true|false|yes|no or omitted which defaults to on

0.2. Conditional configuration and configuration id

The config-id defaults to the first part of the node name as returned by
uname, and can be overridden with the -i or --config-id command line option.

Any configuration line starting with (i.e. before any whitespace) '@' is a
conditional configuration line.  The word immediately following (i.e.
without any space) the '@' character is compared against the config-id,
and if they don't match, the configuration line is ignored.

Alternatively, '@^' is a negative comparison, so if the word immediately
following does NOT match the config-id, the configuration line IS included.

The purpose of this is to allow a single configuration file to be used for
multiple systems, where the only differences are likely to be the router_id,
vrrp instance priorities, and possibly interface names.

For example:

global_defs
{
@main   router_id main_router
@backup router_id backup_router
}
...
vrrp_instance VRRP1 {
    ...
@main    unicast_src_ip 1.2.3.4
@backup  unicast_src_ip 1.2.3.5
@backup2 unicast_src_ip 1.2.3.6

    unicast_peer {
@^main        1.2.3.4
@^backup      1.2.3.5
@^backup2     1.2.3.6
    }
}

If keepalived is invoked with -i main, or if -i is not specified and the node
name is main.SOMETHING, then the router_id will be set to main_router,
if invoked with -i backup, or the node name is backup, then backup_router,
if not invoked with -i and the node name is not main or backup, or with
-i anything else, then the router_id will not be set.

The unicast peers for main will be 1.2.3.5 and 1.2.3.6.

0.3. Scripts

There are three classes of scripts can be configured to be executed.

a. Notify scripts that are run when a vrrp instance or vrrp group changes state,
   or a virtual server quorum changes between up and down.

b. vrrp tracking scripts that will cause vrrp instances to go down it they exit
   a non-zero exist status, or if a weight is specified will add or subtract the
   weight to/from the priority of that vrrp instance.

c. LVS checker misc scripts that will cause a real server to be configured down
   if they exit with a non-zero status.

By default the scripts will be executed by user keepalived_script if that user
exists, or if not by root, but for each script the user/group under which it is
to be executed can be specified.

There are significant security implications if scripts are executed with root
privileges, especially if the scripts themselves are modifiable or replaceable
by a non root user. Consequently, security checks are made at startup to ensure
that if a script is executed by root, then it cannot be modified or replaced by
a non root user.

All scripts should be written so that they will terminate on receipt of a SIGTERM
signal. Scripts will be sent SIGTERM if their parent terminates, or it is a script
the keepalived is awaiting its exit status and it has run for too long.

0.4 include directive

It is possible to include further configuration files from within a configuration
file, and this can be done to any depth.

The format of the include directive is:
include FILENAME

FILENAME can be a fully qualified or relative pathname, and can include wildcards,
including csh style brace expressions such as "{foo/{,cat,dog},bar}" if glob()
supports them.

After opening an included file, the current directory is set to the directory of
the file itself, so any relative paths included from a file are relative to the
directory of the including file itself.

0.5 Parameter substitution

Substitutable parameters can be specified. The format for defining a parameter is:
$PARAMETER=VALUE
where there must be no space before the '=' and only whitespace may preceed to '$'.
Empty values are allowed.

Parameter names can be made up of any combination of A-Za-z0-9 and _, but cannot start
with a digit. Parameter names starting with an underscore should be considered
reserved names that keepalived will define for various pre-defined options.

After a parameter is defined, any occurrence of $PARAMETER followed by
whitespace, or any occurrence of ${PARAMETER} (which need not be followed by
whitespace) will be replaced by VALUE.

Replacement is recursive, so that if a parameter value itself includes a
replaceable parameter, then after the first substitution, the parameter
in the value will then be replaced; the substitution is done at replacement
time and not at definition time, so for example:

$ADDRESS_BASE=10.2.${ADDRESS_BASE_SUB}
$ADDRESS_BASE_SUB=0
    ${ADDRESS_BASE}.100/32
$ADDRESS_BASE_SUB=10
    ${ADDRESS_BASE}.100/32

will produce:
    10.2.0.100/32
    10.2.10.100/32

Note in the above examples the use of both ADDRESS_BASE and ADDRESS_BASE_SUB
required braces ({}) since the parameters were not followed by whitespace
(after the first substitution which produced 10.2.${ADDRESS_BASE_SUB}.100/32
the parameter is still not followed by whitespace).

If a parameter is not defined, it will not be replaced at all, so for
example ${UNDEF_PARAMETER} will remain in the configuration if it is
undefined; this means that existing configuration that contains a '$'
character (for example in a script definition) will not be changed so
long as no new parameter definitions are added to the configuration.

Parameter substitution works in conjunction with conditional configuration.
For example:
@main $PRIORITY=240
@backup $PRIORITY=200
...
vrrp_instance VI_0 {
    priority $PRIORITY
}

will produce:
...
vrrp_instance VI_0 {
    priority 240
}
if the config_id is main.

$IF_MAIN=@main
$IF_MAIN priority 240

will produce
 priority 240
if the config_id is main and nothing if the config_id is not main, although
why anyone would want to use this rather than simply
@main priority 240
is not known.

Multiline definitions are also suppored, but when used there must be nothing on
the line after the parameter name. A multiline definition is specified by ending
each line except the last with a '\' character.

Example:

$INSTANCE= \
vrrp_instance VI_${NUM} { \
    interface eth0.${NUM} \
    use_vmac vrrp${NUM}.1 \
    virtual_router_id 1 \
@high priority 130 \
@low priority 120 \
    advert_int 1 \
    virtual_ipaddress { \
        10.0.${NUM}.254/24 \
    } \
    track_script { \
        offset_instance_${NUM} \
    } \
}

$NUM=0
$INSTANCE

$NUM=1
$INSTANCE

The use of multiline definitions can be nested.

Example:

$RS= \
  real_server 192.168.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM} 80 { \
    weight 1 \
    inhibit_on_failure \
    smtp_alert \
    MISC_CHECK { \
	misc_path "${_PWD}/scripts/vs.sh RS_misc.${INST}.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}.0 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80->192.168.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}:80" \
    } \
    MISC_CHECK { \
        misc_path "${_PWD}/scripts/vs.sh RS_misc.${INST}.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}.1 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80->192.168.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}:80" \
    } \
    notify_up "${_PWD}/scripts/notify.sh RS_notify.${INST}.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM} UP 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80->192.168.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}:80" \
    notify_down "${_PWD}/scripts/notify.sh RS_notify.${INST}.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM} DOWN 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80->192.168.${VS_NUM}.${RS_NUM}:80" \
  }

$VS= \
virtual_server 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4 80 { \
  quorum 2 \
  quorum_up "${_PWD}/scripts/notify.sh VS_notify.${INST} UP 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80" \
  quorum_down "${_PWD}/scripts/notify.sh VS_notify.${INST} DOWN 10.0.${VS_NUM}.4:80" \
$RS_NUM=1 \
$RS \
$RS_NUM=2 \
$RS \
$RS_NUM=3 \
$RS \
}

$VS_NUM=0
$ALPHA=alpha
$VS

$VS_NUM=1
$ALPHA=
$VS

The above will create 2 virtual servers, each with 3 real servers


0.5.1 Pre-defined definitions

The following pre-defined definitions are defined:
${_PWD}		The directory of the current configuration file
		(this can be changed if using the include directive).
${_INSTANCE}	The instance name (as defined by the -i option, defaults
                  to hostname).

Additional pre-defiend definitions will be added as their need is identified.
It will normally be quite straightforward to add additional pre-defiend
definitions, so if you need one, or have a good idea for one, then raise
an issue at https://github.com/acasson/keepalived/issues requesting it.

0.6 Sequence blocks

A line starting ~SEQ(var, start, step, end) will cause the remainder of the
line to be processed multiple times, with the variable $var set initially to
start, and then $var will be incremented by step repeatedly, terminating when
it is greater than end. step may be omitted, in which case it defaults to 1 or
-1, depending on whether end is greater or less than start. Start may also be
omitted, in which case it defaults to 1 if end > 0 or -1 if end < 0.

For example:
  ~SEQ(SUBNET, 0, 3) ip_address 10.0.$SUBNET.1
would produce:
  ip_address 10.0.0.1
  ip_address 10.0.1.1
  ip_address 10.0.2.1
  ip_address 10.0.3.1

There can be multiple ~SEQ elements on a line, so
  $VI4= \
  vrrp_track_file offset_instance_4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} { \
      file "${_PWD}/679/track_files/4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID}" \
      weight -100 \
  } \
  \
  vrrp_instance vrrp4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} { \
      interface bond${IF}.${NUM} \
      use_vmac vrrp4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} \
      virtual_router_id ${ID} \
      priority 130 \
      virtual_ipaddress { \
          10.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID}/24 \
      } \
  \
      track_file { \
          offset_instance_4.${IF}.${NUM}.${ID} \
      } \
  }

  ~SEQ(IF,0,7) ~SEQ(NUM,0,31) ~SEQ(ID,1,254) $VI4

will produce 65024 vrrp instances with names from vrrp4.0.0.1 through to
vrrp4.7.31.254.

0.7 Quoted strings

Quoted strings are specified between " characters; more specifically a string
will only end after a quoted string if there is whitespace afterwards. For
example,
"abcd" efg h jkl "mnop"
will be the single string "abcd efg h jkl mnop", i.e. the embedded " characters
are removed.

Quoted strings can also have escaped characters, like the shell. \a, \b, \E, \f,
\n, \r, \t, \v, \nnn and \xXX (where nnn is up to 3 octal digits, and XX is any
sequence of hex digits) and \cC (which produces the control version of
character C) are all supported. \C for any other character C is just
treated as an escaped version of character C, so \\ is a \ character, and
\" will be a " character, but it won't start or terminate a quoted string.

For specifying scripts with parameters, unquoted spaces will separate the
parameters.  If it is required for a parameter to contain a space, it should
be enclosed in single quotes (').

0.8 Configuration file syntax parser

Traditionally the configuration file parser has not been one of the strengths of
keepalived. yukki maintains a project on github that is a keepalived syntax
checker that may be of use. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/yuuki/gokc

1. Globals configurations

This block is divided in 5 sub-blocks :

    * Global definitions
    * Static track groups
    * Static addresses
    * Static rules
    * Static routes

    1.1. Global definitions

    The configuration block looks like :

       <EMAIL ADDRESS>
       ...
    }
    notification_email_from <EMAIL ADDRESS>   # Email From dealing with SMTP proto

    1.2. Static track groups

    Static track groups are used to allow vrrp instances to track static addresses,
    routes and rules. If a static address/route/rule specifies a track group, then
    if the address/route/rule is deleted, the vrrp instance will transition to backup,
    or to fault state if the address/route/rule cannot be re-added.

    The syntax for a track group is:

    track_group GROUP1 {
        group {
            VI_1
            VI_2
        }
    }

    1.3. Static addresses

    The configuration block looks like :

static_ipaddress {                            # block identification
                                              # If no dev element is specified, it defaults to the default_interface (default eth0)
					      # The track_group specification refers to a named track_group which lists the vrrp instances which
                                              #   will track the address, i.e. if the address is deleted and cannot be restored the vrrp instances
                                              #    will transition to fault state.
                                              # no_track means that the address will not be reinstated if it is deleted
                                              # Note: the broadcast address may be specified as '-' or '+' to clear or set the host
                                              #       bits of the address.
    <IP ADDRESS>[/<MASK>] [brd <IP ADDRESS>] [dev <STRING>] [scope <SCOPE>] [label <LABEL>] [peer <IP ADDRESS>] [home] [-nodad] [mngtmpaddr] [noprefixroute] [autojoin] [track_group GROUP|no_track]

    * site
    * link
    * host
    * nowhere
    * global

                                              #   aren't supported due to ambiguities).

                                              #   due to vrrp instances transitioning from master to backup etc, rules need

static_routes {                               # block identification
                                              # The syntax is the same as ip route add, without "ip route add"
                                              #   (except shorted option names aren't supported due to ambiguities)
                                              # For a description of track_group and no_track, see static_addresses
                                              # If the route could apply to either IPv4 or IPv6 it will default to IPv4.
                                              #   To force a route to be IPv6, add the keyword "inet6"

}

2. VRRP configuration

This block is divided in 5 sub-blocks:

    * VRRP scripts
    * VRRP track files
    * VRRP track BFDs
    * VRRP synchronization group
    * VRRP gratuitous ARP/NA intervals
    * VRRP instance

    2.1. VRRP scripts

    The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_script <STRING> {          # VRRP script declaration
    script <QUOTED_STRING>      # script to run periodically
    interval <INTEGER>          # run the script this every seconds
    timeout <INTEGER>           # script considered failed after 'timeout' seconds
    weight <INTEGER:-253..253>  # adjust priority by this weight
    fall <INTEGER>              # required number of failures for KO switch
    rise <INTEGER>              # required number of successes for OK switch
    user USERNAME [GROUPNAME]   # specify user/group to run script under
    init_fail                   # assume script initially is in failed state
}

The script will be executed periodically, every <interval> seconds. Its exit
code will be recorded for all VRRP instances which monitor it.
Note that the script will only be executed if at least one VRRP instance
monitors it.

The default weight equals 0, which means that any VRRP instance monitoring
the script will transition to the fault state after <fall> consecutive failures
of the script. After that, <rise> consecutive successes will cause VRRP instances to
leave the fault state, unless they are also in the fault state due to other scripts
or interfaces that they are tracking.

A positive weight means that <rise> successes will add <weight> to the priority of all
VRRP instances which monitor it. On the opposite, a negative weight will be subtracted
from the initial priority in case of <fall> failures.

    2.2. VRRP track files

    The configuration block looks like:

vrrp_track_file <STRING> {      # VRRP track file declaration
    file <QUOTED_STRING>        # file to monitor
    weight <-254..254>          # default weight (default is 1)
    init_file [VALUE] [overwrite] # create the file and/or initialise the value
                                # This causes VALUE (default 0) to be written to
                                # the specified file at startup if the file doesn't
                                # exist, unless overwrite is specified in which case
                                # any existing file contents will be overwritten with
                                # the specified value.
}

The file will be read whenever it is modified. The value in the file
will be recorded for all VRRP instances and sync groups which monitor it.
Note that the file will only be read if at least one VRRP instance or
sync group monitors it.

A value will be read as a number in text from the file.  If the weight
configured against the track_file is 0, a non-zero value in the file will
be treated as a failure status, and a zero value will be treated as
an OK status, otherwise the value will be  multiplied by the weight configured
in the track_file statement. If the result is less than -253 any VRRP
instance or sync group monitoring the script will transition to the fault state
(the weight can be 254 to allow for a negative value being read from the file).

If the vrrp instance or sync group is not the address owner and the result is between
-253 and 253, the result will be added to the initial priority of the VRRP instance
(a negative value will reduce the priority), although the effective priority will
be limited to the range [1,254].

If a vrrp instance using a track_file is a member of a sync group, unless
sync_group_tracking_weight is set on the group weight 0 must be set.
Likewise, if the vrrp instance is the address owner, weight 0 must also be set.

    2.3. BFD Configuration

    This is an implementation of RFC5880 (Bidirectional forwarding detection),
    and this can be configured to work between 2 keepalived instances, but using
    unweighted track_bfds between a master/backup pair of VRRP instances means that
    the VRRP instance will only be able to come up if both VRRP instance are running,
    which somewhat defeats the purpose of VRRP.

    This imlpementation has been tested with OpenBFDD (available at
    https://github.com/dyninc/OpenBFDD).

    The configuration block looks like :

bfd_instance <STRING> {
    neighbor_ip <IP ADDRESS>           # BFD Neighbor IP (synonym neighbour_ip)
    source_ip <IP ADDRESS>             # Source IP to use (optional)
    min_rx <INTEGER>                   # Required min RX interval, in ms
                                       # (default is 10 ms)
    min_tx <INTEGER>                   # Desired min TX interval, in ms
                                       # (default is 10 ms)
    idle_tx <INTEGER>                  # Desired idle TX interval, in ms
                                       # (default is 1000 ms)
    multiplier <INTEGER>               # Number of missed packets after
                                       # which the session is declared down
                                       # (default is 5)
    passive                            # Operate in passive mode (default is active)
    ttl <INTEGER 0..255>               # outgoing IPv4 ttl to use (default 255)
    hoplimit <INTEGER 0..255>          # outgoing IPv6 hoplimit to use (default 64)
    max_hops <INTEGER 0..255>          # maximum reduction of ttl/hoplimit in received packet (default 0)
                                       #   (255 disables hop count checking)
    weight <INTEGER -253..253>         # Default tracking weight
    vrrp|checker                       # Only notify vrrp or checker process. Default is notify both.
}

    2.4. VRRP synchronization group

    The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_sync_group <STRING> {      # VRRP sync group declaration
    group {                     # group of instance to sync together
      <STRING>                  #   a
      <STRING>                  #       set
      ...                       #             of VRRP_Instance string
    }
    global_tracking             # DEPRECATED. Use track_interface, track_script and
                                # track_file on vrrp_sync_groups instead.
    sync_group_tracking_weight  # allow sync groups to use differing weights. This
                                # probably WON'T WORK, but is a replacement for
                                # global_tracking in case different weights were used
                                # across different vrrp instances in the same sync
                                # group.
    track_interface {           # Interfaces state we monitor
      <STRING>
      <STRING>
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER:-253..253>
      ...
    }
    track_script {              # Scripts state we monitor
      <STRING>
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER:-253..253>
      ...
    }
    track_file {                # Files state we monitor
      <STRING>			# weight defaults to value configured in the vrrp_track_file
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER: -254..254>
      ...
    }
    track_bfd {                 # BFD instance we monitor
      <STRING>
      <STRING>
      <STRING> weight <INTEGER: -253..253>
      ...
    }

                                # The username and groupname specify the user and group
                                # under which the scripts should be run. If username is
                                # specified, the group defaults to the group of the user.
                                # If username is not specified, they default to the
                                # global script_user and script_group
    notify_master <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> [username [groupname]]
                                # Script to run during MASTER transit
    notify_backup <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> [username [groupname]]
                                # Script to run during BACKUP transit
    notify_fault <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> [username [groupname]]
                                # Script to run during FAULT transit
    notify_stop <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> [username [groupname]]
                                # Script to launch when stopping vrrp
    notify <STRING>|<QUOTED-STRING> [username [groupname]]
                                # Script to run during ANY state transit (1)
    smtp_alert <BOOL>           # Send email notification during state transit
                                #   (default no, unless global smtp_alert/smtp_alert_vrrp set)
}

    Synchronization group tracking scripts and files will update
    the status/priority of all VRRP instances which are members of
    the sync group.

(1) The "notify" script is called AFTER the corresponding notify_* script has
    been called, and is given 4 additional arguments following the configured
    arguments:

    $(n-3) = A string indicating whether it's a "GROUP" or an "INSTANCE"
    $(n-2) = The name of said group or instance
    $(n-1) = The state it's transitioning to ("MASTER", "BACKUP", "FAULT" or "STOP")
    $(n)   = The priority value

    $(n-3) and $(n-1) are ALWAYS sent in uppercase, and the possible strings sent are the
    same ones listed above ("GROUP"/"INSTANCE", "MASTER"/"BACKUP"/"FAULT"/"STOP")
    (note: STOP is only applicable to instances)

Important: for a SYNC group to run reliably, it is vital that all instances in
           the group are MASTER or that they are all either BACKUP or FAULT. A
           situation with half instances having higher priority on machine A
           half others with higher priority on machine B will lead to constant
           re-elections. For this reason, when instances are grouped, any
           track scripts/files configured against member VRRP instances will have
           their tracking weights automatically set to zero, in order to avoid
           inconsistent priorities across instances.

(2) The notify fifo output is the same as the last 4 parameters for the "notify"
    script, with the addition of "MASTER_RX_LOWER_PRI" instead of state for an
    instance. This is used if a master needs to set some external state, such as
    setting a secondary IP address when using Amazon AWS; if another keepalived
    has transitioned to master due to a communications break, the lower priority
    instance will have taken over the secondary IP address, and the proper master
    needs to be able to restore it.

    2.5. VRRP gratuitous ARP/NA intervals

    This section allows the setting of delays between sending gratuitous ARPs
    and unsolicited neighbour advertisements. This is intended for when an
    upstream switch is unable to handle being flooded with ARPs/NAs.

    Use interface when the limits apply on the single physical interface.
    Use interfaces when a group of interfaces are linked to the same switch
    and the limits apply to the switch as a whole.

    Note: Only one of interface or interfaces should be used per block.

garp_group {
    garp_interval <DECIMAL>     # Sets the interval between Gratuitous ARP
                                #   (in seconds, resolution microseconds)
    gna_interval <DECIMAL>      # Sets the default interval between unsolicited NA
                                #   (in seconds, resolution microseconds)
    interface <STRING>          # The physical interface to which the intervals apply
    interfaces {                # A list of interfaces across which the delays are
        <STRING>                #   aggregated.
        <STRING>
        ...
    }
}

    If the global vrrp_garp_interval and/or vrrp_gna_interval are set, any
    interfaces that aren't specified in a garp_group will inherit the global
    settings.

    2.6. VRRP instance

    The configuration block looks like :

vrrp_instance <STRING> {                      # VRRP instance declaration
    use_vmac [<NAME>]                         # Use VRRP Virtual MAC, optional NAME of interface
                                              # NOTE: If sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter is set,
                                              # and this vrrp_instance is an IPv4 instance, using
                                              # this option will cause the individual interfaces to be
                                              # updated to the greater of their current setting and
                                              # all.rp_filter, as will default.rp_filter, and all.rp_filter
                                              # will be set to 0.
                                              # The original settings are restored on termination.

}

SCOPE can take the following values :
    * site
    * link
    * host
    * nowhere
    * global

LABEL is optional and creates a name for the alias. For compatibility with
"ifconfig", it should be of the form <realdev>:<anytext>, for example
eth0:1 for an alias on eth0.

METRIC is optional and specify a route priority.

When a weight is specified in track_interface, instead of setting the vrrp
instance to the FAULT state in case of failure, its priority will be
increased by the weight when the interface is up (for positive weights),
or decreased by the weight's absolute value when the interface is down
(for negative weights). The weight must be comprised between -254 and +254
inclusive. 0 is the default behaviour which means that a failure implies a
FAULT state. The common practice is to use positive weights to count a
limited number of good services so that the server with the highest count
becomes master. Negative weights are better to count unexpected failures
among a high number of interfaces, as it will not saturate even with high
number of interfaces.

The same principle can be applied to track_script entries, except that an
unspecified weight means that the default weight declared in the script
will be used (which itself defaults to 0).


3. LVS configuration

This block is divided in 2 sub-block :

    * Virtual server group
    * Virtual server
    * SSL config

    3.1. Virtual server group

    The configuration block looks like :

virtual_server_group <STRING> {
    <IP ADDRESS> [<PORT>]       # VIP [VPORT]
    <IP ADDRESS> [<PORT>]
    ...
    <IP ADDRESS RANGE> [<PORT>] # VIP range [VPORT]
    <IP ADDRESS RANGE> [<PORT>]
    ...
    fwmark <INTEGER>            # fwmark
    fwmark <INTEGER>
    ...
}

Note:   <IP ADDRESS RANGE> has the form of : XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW-VVV, define
        the IP address range starting at WWW and monotonaly incremented by
        one to VVV. Example : 192.168.200.1-10 means .1 to .10 IP addresses.

    3.2. Virtual server

    The configuration block looks like :

    A virtual_server can be either :
    * vip vport declaration
    * fwmark declaration
    * group declaration

    Note: Where an option can be configured for a virtual server, real server,
    and possibly checker, the virtual server setting is the default for real servers,
    and the real server setting is the default for checkers.

    Note 2: Tunnelled real/sorry servers can differ from the address family of
    the virtual server and non tunnelled real/sorry servers, which all have to be the
    same. If a virtual server uses a fwmark, and all the real/sorry servers are
    tunnelled, the address family of the virtual server will be the same as the
    address family of the real/sorry servers if they are all the same, otherwise
    it will default to IPv4 (use ip_family inet6 to override this).

    Note 3: The port for the virtual server can only be omitted if the virtual service
    is persistent.
