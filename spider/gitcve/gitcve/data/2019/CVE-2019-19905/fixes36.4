This fixes36.4 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.3 in December 2019.  Hypothetical version
3.6.4 may not be released, in which case these fixes will appear in 3.7.0.

GDBPATH and GREPPATH from sysconf or -D... on compilation command line were
	being processed even if PANICTRACE was disabled but only being freed
	at end of game when that was enabled
fix the article used in the message when your steed encounters a polymorph trap
allow teleporting onto the vibrating square
message "your knapsack can't accomodate any more items" when picking stuff up
