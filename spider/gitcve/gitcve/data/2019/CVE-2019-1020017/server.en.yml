      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for starting a new conversation!**

      - Does the title sound interesting if you read it out loud? Is it a good summary?

      - Who would be interested in this? Why does it matter? What kind of responses do you want?

      - Include commonly used words in your topic so others can *find* it. To group your topic with related topics, select a category.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](%{base_path}/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

    "new-reply": |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for contributing!**

      - Does your reply improve the conversation in some way?

      - Be kind to your fellow community members.

      - Constructive criticism is welcome, but criticize *ideas*, not people.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](%{base_path}/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

      ### How about a picture for your account?

      You’ve posted a few topics and replies, but your profile picture isn’t as unique as you are – it’s just a letter.

      Have you considered **[visiting your user profile](%{profile_path})** and uploading a picture that represents you?

      It’s easier to follow discussions and find interesting people in conversations when everyone has a unique profile picture!

    sequential_replies: |
      ### Consider replying to several posts at once

      Rather than several replies to a topic in a row, please consider a single reply that includes quotes from previous posts or @name references.

      You can edit your previous reply to add a quote by highlighting text and selecting the <b>quote reply</b> button that appears.

      It’s easier for everyone to read topics that have fewer in-depth replies versus lots of small, individual replies.

    dominating_topic: |
      ### Let others join the conversation

      This topic is clearly important to you &ndash; you've posted more than %{percent}% of the replies here.

      It could be even better if you got other people space to share their points of view, too. Can you invite them over?

    get_a_room: |
      ### Encourage everyone to get involved in the conversation

      You’ve replied %{count} times to @%{reply_username} in this particular topic!

      A great discussion involves many voices and perspectives. Can you get anybody else involved?

      And don’t forget, if you’d like to continue your conversation with this particular user at length outside of public view, [send them a personal message](%{base_path}/u/%{reply_username}).

    too_many_replies: |
      ### You have reached the reply limit for this topic

      We’re sorry, but new users are temporarily limited to %{newuser_max_replies_per_topic} replies in the same topic.

      Instead of adding another reply, please consider editing your previous replies, or visiting other topics.

    reviving_old_topic: |
      ### Revive this topic?

      The last reply to this topic was **%{time_ago}**. Your reply will bump the topic to the top of its list and notify anyone previously involved in the conversation.

      Are you sure you want to continue this old conversation?

      This is a test email from

      [**%{base_url}**][0]

      Email deliverability is complicated. Here are a few important things you should check first:

      - Be *sure* to set the `notification email` from: address correctly in your site settings. **The domain specified in the "from" address of the emails you send is the domain your email will be validated against**.

      - Know how to view the raw source of the email in your mail client, so you can examine email headers for important clues. In Gmail, it is the "show original" option in the drop-down menu at the top right of each mail.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain names and IP addresses you send mail from? [Test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If your ISP does not enter the proper reverse DNS pointer record, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's [SPF record][8] correct? [Test your SPF record][1] here. Note that TXT is the correct official record type for SPF.

      - Is your domain's [DKIM record][3] correct? This will significantly improve email deliverability. [Test your DKIM record][7] here.

      - If you run your own mail server, check to make sure the IPs of your mail server are [not on any email blacklists][4]. Also verify that it is definitely sending a fully-qualified hostname that resolves in DNS in its HELO message. If not, this will cause your email to be rejected by many mail services.

      - We highly recommend you **send a test email to [mail-tester.com][mt]** to verify that all the above is working correctly.

      (The *easy* way is to create a free account on [SendGrid][sg], [SparkPost][sp], [Mailgun][mg] or [Mailjet][mj], which have generous free mailing plans and will be fine for small communities. You'll still need to set up the SPF and DKIM records in your DNS, though!)

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,

      Your friends at [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)

        Hello,

        This is an automated message from %{site_name} to let you know you that your account has been placed on hold due to a large number of community flags.

        As a precautionary measure, your new account has been silenced from creating new replies or topics until a staff member can review your account.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

        For additional guidance, please refer to our [community guidelines](%{base_url}/guidelines).

        Hello,

        This is an automated message from %{site_name} to let you know that your account has been temporarily placed on hold as a precautionary measure.

        Please do continue to browse, but you won't be able to reply or create topics until a [staff member](%{base_url}/about) reviews your most recent posts. We apologize for the inconvenience.

        For additional guidance, refer to our [community guidelines](%{base_url}/guidelines).

    user_automatically_silenced:
      title: "User Automatically Silenced"
      subject_template: "New user %{username} silenced by community flags"
      text_body_template: |
        This is an automated message.

        The new user [%{username}](%{user_url}) was automatically silenced because multiple users flagged %{username}'s post(s).

        Please [review the flags](%{base_url}/admin/flags). If %{username} was incorrectly silenced from posting, click the unsilence button on [the admin page for this user](%{user_url}).

        This threshold can be changed via the `silence_new_user` site settings.

      title: "Spam Post Blocked"

        This is an automated message.

        The new user [%{username}](%{user_url}) tried to create multiple posts with links to %{domains}, but those posts were blocked to avoid spam. The user is still able to create new posts that do not link to %{domains}.

        Please [review the user](%{user_url}).

        This can be modified via the `newuser_spam_host_threshold` and `white_listed_spam_host_domains` site settings. Consider adding %{domains} to the whitelist if they should be exempt.

      ## [This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion](#civilized)

      Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park.  We, too, are a shared community resource &mdash; a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

      These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

      <a name="improve"></a>

      ## [Improve the Discussion](#improve)

      Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

      The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

      One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

      <a name="agreeable"></a>

      ## [Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree](#agreeable)

      You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to _criticize ideas, not people_. Please avoid:

      *   Name-calling
      *   Ad hominem attacks
      *   Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
      *   Knee-jerk contradiction

      Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

      <a name="participate"></a>

      ## [Your Participation Counts](#participate)

      The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be &mdash; and avoiding those that do not.

      Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

      Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

      <a name="flag-problems"></a>

      ## [If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)

      Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

      When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. _Just flag it_. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.

      In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

      <a name="be-civil"></a>

      ## [Always Be Civil](#be-civil)

      Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

      *   Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
      *   Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
      *   Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
      *   Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

      These are not concrete terms with precise definitions &mdash; avoid even the _appearance_ of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

      This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

      <a name="keep-tidy"></a>

      ## [Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)

      Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

      *   Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
      *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
      *   Don’t post no-content replies.
      *   Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
      *   Don’t sign your posts &mdash; every post has your profile information attached to it.

      Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

      <a name="stealing"></a>

      ## [Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)

      You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.

      <a name="power"></a>

      ## [Powered by You](#power)

      This site is operated by your [friendly local staff](%{base_path}/about) and *you*, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the [site feedback category](%{base_path}/c/site-feedback) and let's discuss! If there's a critical or urgent issue that can't be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the [staff page](%{base_path}/about).

      <a name="tos"></a>

      ## [Terms of Service](#tos)

      Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves &ndash; and by extension, you and your data &ndash; against unfriendly folks. We have a [Terms of Service](%{base_path}/tos) describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our [TOS](%{base_path}/tos).

  tos_topic:

      These terms govern use of the Internet forum at <%{base_url}>.  To use the forum, you must agree to these terms with %{company_name}, the company that runs the forum.

      The company may offer other products and services, under different terms.  These terms apply only to use of the forum.

      <h2 id="heading--important-terms"><a href="#heading--important-terms">Important Terms</a></h2>

      ***These terms include a number of important provisions that affect your rights and responsibilities, such as the disclaimers in [Disclaimers](#heading--disclaimers), limits on the company's liability to you in [Limits on Liability](#heading--liability), your agreement to cover the company for damages caused by your misuse of the forum in [Responsibility for Your Use](#heading--responsibility), and an agreement to arbitrate disputes in [Disputes](#heading--disputes).***

      <h2 id="heading--permission"><a href="#heading--permission">Your Permission to Use the Forum</a></h2>

      Subject to these terms, the company gives you permission to use the forum.  Everyone needs to agree to these terms to use the forum.

      <h2 id="heading--conditions"><a href="#heading--conditions">Conditions for Use of the Forum</a></h2>

      Your permission to use the forum is subject to the following conditions:

      1.  You must be at least thirteen years old.

      2.  You may no longer use the forum if the company contacts you directly to say that you may not.

      3.  You must use the forum in accordance with [Acceptable Use](#heading--acceptable-use) and [Content Standards](#heading--content-standards).

      <h2 id="heading--acceptable-use"><a href="#heading--acceptable-use">Acceptable Use</a></h2>

      1.  You may not break the law using the forum.

      2.  You may not use or try to use another's account on the forum without their specific permission.

      3.  You may not buy, sell, or otherwise trade in user names or other unique identifiers on the forum.

      4.  You may not send advertisements, chain letters, or other solicitations through the forum, or use the forum to gather addresses or other personal data for commercial mailing lists or databases.

      5.  You may not automate access to the forum, or monitor the forum, such as with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer program that is not a web browser.  You may crawl the forum to index it for a publicly available search engine, if you run one.

      6.  You may not use the forum to send e-mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or group mail aliases.

      7.  You may not falsely imply that you're affiliated with or endorsed by the company.

      8.  You may not hyperlink to images or other non-hypertext content on the forum on other webpages.

      9.  You may not remove any marks showing proprietary ownership from materials you download from the forum.

      10.  You may not show any part of the forum on other websites with `<iframe>`.

      11. You may not disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access restrictions of the forum.

      12. You may not strain infrastructure of the forum with an unreasonable volume of requests, or requests designed to impose an unreasonable load on information systems underlying the forum.

      13.  You may not impersonate others through the forum.

      14. You may not encourage or help anyone in violation of these terms.

      <h2 id="heading--content-standards"><a href="#heading--content-standards">Content Standards</a></h2>

      1.  You may not submit content to the forum that is illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful to others.  This includes content that is harassing, inappropriate, or abusive.

      2.  You may not submit content to the forum that violates the law, infringes anyone's intellectual property rights, violates anyone's privacy, or breaches agreements you have with others.

      3.  You may not submit content to the forum containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses or spyware.

      4.  You may not submit content to the forum as a mere placeholder, to hold a particular address, user name, or other unique identifier.

      5.  You may not use the forum to disclose information that you don't have the right to disclose, like others' confidential or personal information.

      <h2 id="heading--enforcement"><a href="#heading--enforcement">Enforcement</a></h2>

      The company may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent.  The company may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.

      The company reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the forum for any reason.  If you believe someone has submitted content to the forum in violation of these terms, [contact us immediately](#heading--contact).

      <h2 id="heading--your-account"><a href="#heading--your-account">Your Account</a></h2>

      You must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.

      To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself.  If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date.  You may close your account at any time by e-mailing <%{contact_email}>.

      You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised.  You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.  You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.

      The company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you've broken any rule in these terms.

      <h2 id="heading--your-content"><a href="#heading--your-content">Your Content</a></h2>

      Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum.  Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company's intellectual property, either.

      Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum.  You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company.  These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.

      Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.  But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum.  That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.

      When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company's special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company's backups, caches, and other systems.  Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) licenses, may continue after your content is removed.  Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.

      Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.  You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

      <h2 id="heading--responsibility"><a href="#heading--responsibility">Your Responsibility</a></h2>

      You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.  Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.  If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won't have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.  You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.  The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.

      <h2 id="heading--disclaimers"><a href="#heading--disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></h2>

      ***You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum.  As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.***

      The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others.  The company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide.  Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.

      <h2 id="heading--liability"><a href="#heading--liability">Limits on Liability</a></h2>

      ***Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.***

      ***As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.***

      <h2 id="heading--feedback"><a href="#heading--feedback">Feedback</a></h2>

      The company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum.  See the [Contact](#heading--contact) section below for ways to get in touch with us.

      You agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won't have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you.  You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.

      <h2 id="heading--termination"><a href="#heading--termination">Termination</a></h2>

      Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time.  When our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.

      The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: [Your Content](#heading--your-content), [Feedback](#heading--feedback), [Your Responsibility](#heading--responsibility), [Disclaimers](#heading--disclaimers), [Limits on Liability](#heading--liability), and [General Terms](#heading--general).

      <h2 id="heading--disputes"><a href="#heading--disputes">Disputes</a></h2>

      %{governing_law} will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.

      You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in %{city_for_disputes}.  Neither you nor the company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.

      ***Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration.  Arbitration will follow the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  Arbitration will happen in %{city_for_disputes}.  You will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member.  No arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without the company's permission.***

      Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses.  You and the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.

      <h2 id="heading--general"><a href="#heading--general">General Terms</a></h2>

      If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.  Otherwise, that provision should be removed.

      You may not assign your agreement with the company.  The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.  Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.

      Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.

      These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum.  These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.

      <h2 id="heading--contact"><a href="#heading--contact">Contact</a></h2>

      You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at <%{contact_email}>.

      The company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.

      <h2 id="heading--changes"><a href="#heading--changes">Changes</a></h2>

      The company last updated these terms on July 12, 2018, and may update these terms again.  The company will post all updates to the forum.  For updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you've created an account and provided a valid e-mail address.  The company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.

      Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.
