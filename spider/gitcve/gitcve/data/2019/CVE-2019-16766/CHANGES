1.2.0 (2019-10-30)
==================
 - Added missing deps for generation of the docs
 - Added Microsoft Authenticator as example app and removed double space
 - Allow admins to delete devices from user accounts


1.1.0 (2019-03-28)
==================
 - Require the user to enter their password when creating a new token. This is
   done based on feedback of a security test by an external company.
 - Remove the "Manage 2FA button" on the user listing for now since that didn't
   actually work. It always managed the devices of the current logged in user.
   This will be added properly in a later version.
 - Make the package compatible with django-hosts. The middleware initially
   resolved a number of paths on start up time, this is now lazy.
 - Update django-otp to version 5.2.0
 - Update qrcode to version 6.1
