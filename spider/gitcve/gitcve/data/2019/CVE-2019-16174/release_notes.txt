Changes from 0.991 to 0.992

New features:

Added croatian language file (submitted by Ivana Pavic)!
Change survey sent/taken from "Y" to the date:
    When reviewing the tokens display, the fields telling if the survey request was sent,
    and the survey taken, display a N or Y. This was changed to be the actual date this event took place.
    This is giving some siginificant additional information to the survey author. (Patch by Thomas Ringate / tringate!)
New global option that allows the administrator to specify what is the minimum number of remaining answers
    in an 'array - flexible' question that must be remaining before repeating the question headings. This
    avoids that the headings of the question are repeated if only a few answers are remaining. (Patch by Kris Ven !)

Changes:
Moved admin CSS styles to separate CSS file
Updated slovenian language file
Updated dutch language file
Updated french language file (by Pascal Bastien/pascal-gnu)

=========================

1.) New question types

* List type question divided into two question types - radio
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together.
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.
  READ THE STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE!!!!

* Question attributes, allows for better control over the display
and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
