/* diskstore.c implements a very simple disk backed key-value store used
 * by Redis for the "disk" backend. This implementation uses the filesystem
 * to store key/value pairs. Every file represents a given key.
 *
 * The key path is calculated using the SHA1 of the key name. For instance
 * the key "foo" is stored as a file name called:
 *
 *  /0b/ee/0beec7b5ea3f0fdbc95d0dd47f3c5bc275da8a33
 *
 * The couples of characters from the hex output of SHA1 are also used
 * to locate two two levels of directories to store the file (as most
 * filesystems are not able to handle too many files in a single dir).
 *
 * In the end there are 65536 final directories (256 directories inside
 * every 256 top level directories), so that with 1 billion of files every
 * directory will contain in the average 15258 entires, that is ok with
 * most filesystems implementation.
 *
 * The actaul implementation of this disk store is highly related to the
 * filesystem implementation. This implementation may be replaced by
 * a B+TREE implementation in future implementations.
 *
 * Data ok every key is serialized using the same format used for .rdb
 * serialization. Everything is serialized on every entry: key name,
 * ttl information in case of keys with an associated expire time, and the
 * serialized value itself.
 *
 * Because the format is the same of the .rdb files it is trivial to create
 * an .rdb file starting from this format just by mean of scanning the
 * directories and concatenating entries, with the sole addition of an
 * .rdb header at the start and the end-of-db opcode at the end.
