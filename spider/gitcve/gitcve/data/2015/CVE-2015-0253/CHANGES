Changes with Apache 2.5.0

  *) core: If explicitly configured, use the KeepaliveTimeout value of the
     virtual host which handled the latest request on the connection, or by
     default the one of the first virtual host bound to the same IP:port.
     PR56226.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_authn_core: Add expression support to AuthName and AuthType.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_deflate: A misplaced check prevents limiting small bodies with the
     new inflate limits. PR56872. [Edward Lu, Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic]

  *) ab: Add missing longest request (100%) to CSV export.
     [Marcin Fabrykowski <bugzilla fabrykowski.pl>]

  *) core: Add expression support to ErrorDocument. Switch from a fixed
     sized 664 byte array per merge to a hash table. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Add the SSL_CLIENT_CERT_RFC4523_CEA variable, which provides
     a combination of certificate serialNumber and issuer as defined by
     CertificateExactMatch in RFC4523. [Graham Leggett]

  *) suexec: Filter out the HTTP_PROXY environment variable because it is
     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Use the "Connection: close" header for requests to
     backends not recycling connections (disablereuse), including the default
     reverse and forward proxies.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't expect the backend to ack the "Connection: close" to
     finally close those not meant to be kept alive by SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive
     or force-proxy-request-1.0, and respond with 502 instead of 400 if its
     Connection header is invalid.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy(es): Avoid error response/document handling by the core if some
     input filter already did it while reading client's payload. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) http: Make ap_die() robust against any HTTP error code and not modify
     response status (finally logged) when nothing is to be done. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_connect/wstunnel: If both client and backend sides get readable
     at the same time, don't lose errors occuring while forwarding on the first
     side when none occurs next on the other side, and abort.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_macro: Clear macros before initialization to avoid use-after-free
     on startup or restart when the module is linked statically. PR 57525
     [apache.org tech.futurequest.net, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed
     to be alive and the first bytes sent: this is a best effort to prevent the
     backend from closing because of idle or keepalive timeout in the meantime.
     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Define and UnDefine are no longer permitted in
     directory context. Previously they would always be evaulated
     as the configuration was read without regard for the directory
     context. [Eric Covener]

  *) config: For directives that do not expect any arguments, enforce
     that none are specified in the configuration file. 
     [Joachim Zobel <jzobel heute-morgen.de>, Eric Covener]

     PR 57100.  [Michael Kaufmann <apache-bugzilla michael-kaufmann.ch>,
     Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_alias: Introduce expression parser support for Alias, ScriptAlias
     and Redirect. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Add support for extracting subjectAltName entries of type
     rfc822Name and dNSName into SSL_{CLIENT,SERVER}_SAN_{Email,DNS}_n
     environment variables. Also addresses PR 57207. [Kaspar Brand]

  *) mod_proxy: Don't put non balancer-member workers in error state by
     default for connection or 500/503 errors, and honor status=+I for
     any error.  PR 48388.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_socache_memcache: Pass expiration time through to memcached. PR 55445.
     [Faidon Liambotis <paravoid debian.org>, Joe Orton]

  *) mod_http: Fix incorrect If-Match handling. PR 57358.
     [Kunihiko Sakamoto <ksakamoto google.com>]

     context for directories found by mod_userdir and mod_alias.  These no
     longer require RewriteBase to be specified. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Resolve crashes with LDAP authz and non-LDAP authn since 
     r1608202. [Eric Covener]
 
  *) mod_buffer: Forward flushed input data immediatly and avoid (unlikely)
     access to freed memory. [Yann Ylavic, Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_proxy: Use the correct server name for SNI in case the backend
     SSL connection itself is established via a proxy server.
     PR 57139 [Szabolcs Gyurko <szabolcs gyurko.org>]

  *) core: Ensure that httpd exits with an error status when the MPM fails
     to run.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) apreq: Content-Length header should be always interpreted as a decimal.
     Leading 0 could be erroneously considered as an octal value. PR 56598.
     [Chris Card <ctcard hotmail com>]
  
  *) mod_proxy: Now allow for 191 character worker names, with non-fatal
     errors if name is truncated. PR53218. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_ssl: Add optional function "ssl_get_tls_cb" to allow support
     for channel bindings.  [Simo Sorce <simo redhat.com>]

     the service control interface for Windows.  [William Rowe]
  
  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Return LDAP connections to the pool before the handler
     is run, instead of waiting until the end of the request. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_ssl: dump SSL IO/state for the write side of the connection(s),
     like reads (level TRACE4). [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy: Shutdown (eg. close notify) the backend connection before
     closing. [Yann Ylavic] 

  *) mpm_event[opt]: Send the SSL close notify alert when the KeepAliveTimeout
     expires. PR54998. [Yann Ylavic] 

  *) mod_ssl: Ensure that the SSL close notify alert is flushed to the client.
     PR54998. [Tim Kosse <tim.kosse filezilla-project.org>, Yann Ylavic] 

  *) mod_log_config: Add GlobalLog to allow a globally defined log to
     be inherited by virtual hosts that define a CustomLog.
     [Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to
     guard against LDAP injection. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add module mod_ssl_ct, which provides an implementation of Certificate
     Transparency (RFC 6962) for httpd.  [Jeff Trawick]

     from the ones to be forwarded to the backend. PR 45387.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_remoteip: Prevent an external proxy from presenting an internal
     proxy. PR 55962. [Mike Rumph]
