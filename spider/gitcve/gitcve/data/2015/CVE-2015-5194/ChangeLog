* [Bug 1517] ntpq and ntpdc should verify reverse DNS before use.
  ntpq and ntpdc now use the following format for showing purported
  DNS names from IP address "reverse" DNS lookups when the DNS name
  does not exist or does not include the original IP address among

(4.2.7p22) 2010/04/02 Released by Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>
* [Bug 1432] Don't set inheritable flag for linux capabilities.

* [Bug 1483] AI_NUMERICSERV undefined in 4.2.7p20.
* [Bug 1497] fudge is broken by getnetnum() change.
* [Bug 1503] Auto-enabling of monitor for "restrict ... limited" wrong.
* [Bug 1504] ntpdate tickles ntpd "discard minimum 1" rate limit if
  "restrict ... limited" is used.
* ntpdate: stop querying source after KoD packet response, log it.
* ntpdate: rate limit each server to 2s between packets.
* From J. N. Perlinger: avoid pointer wraparound warnings in dolfptoa(),
  printf format mismatches with 64-bit size_t.
* Broadcast client (ephemeral) associations should be demobilized only
  if they are not heard from for 10 consecutive polls, regardless of
  surviving the clock selection.  Fix from David Mills.
* Add "ntpq -c ifstats" similar to "ntpdc -c ifstats".
* Add "ntpq -c sysstats" similar to "ntpdc -c sysstats".
* Add "ntpq -c monstats" to show monlist knobs and stats.
* Add "ntpq -c mrulist" similar to "ntpdc -c monlist" but not
  limited to 600 rows, and with filtering and sorting options:
  ntpq -c "mrulist mincount=2 laddr=192.168.1.2 sort=-avgint"
  ntpq -c "mrulist sort=addr"
  ntpq -c "mrulist mincount=2 sort=count"
  ntpq -c "mrulist sort=-lstint"
* Modify internal representation of MRU list to use l_fp fixed-point
  NTP timestamps instead of seconds since startup.  This increases the
  resolution and substantially improves accuracy of sorts involving
  timestamps, at the cost of flushing all MRU entries when the clock is
  stepped, to ensure the timestamps can be compared with the current
  get_systime() results.
* Add ntp.conf "mru" directive to configure MRU parameters, such as
  "mru mindepth 600 maxage 64 maxdepth 5000 maxmem 1024" or
  "mru initalloc 0 initmem 16 incalloc 99 incmem 4".  Several pairs are
  equivalent with one in units of MRU entries and its twin in units of
  kilobytes of memory, so the last one used in ntp.conf controls:
  maxdepth/maxmem, initalloc/initmem, incalloc/incmem.  With the above
  values, ntpd will preallocate 16kB worth of MRU entries, allocating
  4kB worth each time more are needed, with a hard limit of 1MB of MRU
  entries.  Until there are more than 600 entries none would be reused.
  Then only entries for addresses last seen 64 seconds or longer ago are
  reused.
* Limit "ntpdc -c monlist" response in ntpd to 600 entries, the previous
  overall limit on the MRU list depth which was driven by the monlist
  implementation limit of one request with a single multipacket
  response.
* New "pool" directive implementation modeled on manycastclient.
* Do not abort on non-ASCII characters in ntp.conf, ignore them.
* ntpq: increase response reassembly limit from 24 to 32 packets, add
  discussion in comment regarding results with even larger MAXFRAGS.
* ntpq: handle "passwd MYPASSWORD" (without prompting) as with ntpdc.
* ntpdc: do not examine argument to "passwd" if not supplied.
* configure: remove check for pointer type used with qsort(), we
  require ANSI C which mandates void *.
* Reset sys_kodsent to 0 in proto_clr_stats().
* Add sptoa()/sockporttoa() similar to stoa()/socktoa() adding :port.
* Use memcpy() instead of memmove() when buffers can not overlap.
* Remove sockaddr_storage from our sockaddr_u union of sockaddr,
  sockaddr_in, and sockaddr_in6, shaving about 100 bytes from its size
  and substantially decreasing MRU entry memory consumption.
* Extend ntpq readvar (alias rv) to allow fetching up to three named
  variables in one operation:  ntpq -c "rv 0 version offset frequency".
* ntpq: use srchost variable to show .POOL. prototype associations'
  hostname instead of address 0.0.0.0.
* "restrict source ..." configures override restrictions for time
  sources, allows tight default restrictions to be used with the pool
  directive (where server addresses are not known in advance).
* Ignore "preempt" modifier on manycastclient and pool prototype
  associations.  The resulting associations are preemptible, but the
  prototype must not be.
* Maintain and use linked list of associations (struct peer) in ntpd,
  avoiding walking 128 hash table entries to iterate over peers.
* Remove more workarounds unneeded since we require ISO C90 AKA ANSI C:
  - remove fallback implementations for memmove(), memset, strstr().
  - do not test for atexit() or memcpy().
* Collapse a bunch of code duplication in ntpd/ntp_restrict.c added with
  support for IPv6.
* Correct some corner case failures in automatically enabling the MRU
  list if any "restrict ... limited" is in effect, and in disabling MRU
  maintenance. (ntp_monitor.c, ntp_restrict.c)
* Reverse the internal sort order of the address restriction lists, but
  preserve the same behavior.  This allows removal of special-case code
  related to the default restrictions and more straightforward lookups
  of restrictions for a given address (now, stop on first match).
* Move ntp_restrict.c MRU doubly-linked list maintenance code into
  ntp_lists.h macros, allowing more duplicated source excision.
* Repair ntpdate.c to no longer test HAVE_TIMER_SETTIME.
* Do not reference peer_node/unpeer_node after freeing when built with
  --disable-saveconfig and using DNS.

  address enumeration, allowing ntpq and ntpdc's hardcoding to 127.0.0.1

  I've now spent eleven months of a sabbatical year - 7 days a week, 6-10
  hours most days - working on NTP. I have carefully reviewed every major
  algorithm, examined its original design and evolution from that design.
  I've trimmed off dead code and briar patches and did zillions of tests
  contrived to expose evil vulnerabilities. The development article is in
  rather good shape and should be ready for prime time.

  1. The protostats statistics files have been very useful in exposing
  little twitches and turns when something hiccups, like a broken PPS
  signal. Most of what used to be syslog messages are now repackaged as
  protostats messages with optional syslog as well. These can also be sent
  as traps which might be handy to tiggle a beeper or celltext. These, the
  sysstats files and cryptostats files reveal the ambient health of a busy
  server, monitor traffic and error counts and spot crypto attacks.

  2. Close inspection of the clock discipline behavior at long poll
  intervals (36 h) showed it not doing as well as it should. I redesigned
  the FLL loop to improve nominal accuracy from  several tens of
  milliseconds to something less than ten milliseconds.

  3. Autokey (again). The enhanced error checking was becoming a major
  pain. I found a way to toss out gobs of ugly fat code and replace the
  function with a much simpler and more comprehensive scheme. It resists
  bait-and-switch attacks and quickly detect cases when the protocol is
  not correctly synchronized.

  4. The interface code for the kernel PPS signal was not in sync with the
  kernel code itself. Some error checks were duplicated and some
  ineffective. I found none of the PPS-capable drivers, including the atom
  driver, do anything when the prefer peer fails; the kernel PPS signal
  remains in control. The atom driver now disables the kernel PPS when the
  prefer peer comes bum. This is important when the prefer peer is not a
  reference clock but a remote NTP server.

  5. The flake restrict bit turned out to be really interesting,
  especially with symmtric modes and of those especially those using
  Autokey. Small changes in the recovery procedures when packets are lost
  now avoid almost all scenarios which previously required protocol resets.

  6. I've always been a little uncomfortable when using the clock filter
  with long poll intervals because the samples become less and less
  correlated as the sample age exceeds the Allan intercept. Various
  schemes have been used over the years to cope with this fact. The latest
  one and the one that works the best is to use a modified sort metric
  where the delay is used when the age of the sample is less than the
  intercept and the sum of delay and dispersion above that. The net result
  is that, at small poll intervals the algorithm operates as a minimum
  filter, while at larger poll intervals it morphs to FIFO. Left
  unmodified, a sample could be used when twelve days old. This along with
  the FLL modifications has made a dramatic improvement at large poll
  intervals.

- [Backward Incompatible] The 'state' variable is no longer reported or
  available via ntpq output.  The following system status bit names
  have been changed:
  - sync_alarm -> leap_alarm
  - sync_atomic -> sync_pps
  - sync_lf_clock -> sync_lf_radio
  - sync_hf_clock -> sync_hf_radio
  - sync_uhf_clock -> sync_uhf_radio
  - sync_local_proto -> sync_local
  - sync_udp/time -> sync_other
  Other names have been changed as well.  See the change history for
  libntp/statestr.c for more details.
  Other backward-incompatible changes in ntpq include:
  - assID -> associd
  - rootdispersion -> rootdisp
  - pkt_head -> pkt_neader
  See the change history for other details.
