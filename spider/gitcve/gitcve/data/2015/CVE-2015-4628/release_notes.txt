=== UPGRADING=====

We suggest to check out and hold close to the instructions, which can be found in our online manual:
https://manual.limesurvey.org/Upgrading_from_a_previous_version
 

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<=1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Since the data structure and a lot of other things were changed, upgrading from any version previous to v1.50 is NOT possible. 
If you have old survey structure files with a *.sql extension the only way to get these into a newer version is to install version 1.50, import the .sql file(s) there, then upgrade that version to the most recent LimeSurvey version. 


HOW TO UPGRADE from LimeSurvey 1.50 or later (<=1.70)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database. REALLY, create backups FIRST!
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place.
6. Run the installer by visiting http://<yourdomain>/<yourlimesurveypath>/admin and follow the instructions
7. Restore any customized templates from your backup to /upload/templates (old version older than 1.70 either from /templates or from /upload/templates (>1.70)). You might have to adjust your templates since the CSS/structure might been changed since. 
   It is usually easier to customize a default templates, again, instead of fixing your old template! 
8. Done.

TEMPLATE modification between LimeSurvey 1.8
------------------------------------------------------
LimeSurvey 2 use a new placeholder for javascript inclusion: {TEMPLATEJS}.
Old template can be incompatible with the new javascript inclusion system. LimeSurvey need a placeholder to include js file for public survey.
The update process and the template upload process try to update your template. If there are javascript issue with your custom template, control you have the placeholder {TEMPLACEJS} in your starpage.pstpl.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

Changes from 0.991 to 0.992

New features:

Added croatian language file (submitted by Ivana Pavic)!
Change survey sent/taken from "Y" to the date:
	When reviewing the tokens display, the fields telling if the survey request was sent, 
	and the survey taken, display a N or Y. This was changed to be the actual date this event took place. 
	This is giving some siginificant additional information to the survey author. (Patch by Thomas Ringate / tringate!)
New global option that allows the administrator to specify what is the minimum number of remaining answers 
	in an 'array - flexible' question that must be remaining before repeating the question headings. This 
	avoids that the headings of the question are repeated if only a few answers are remaining. (Patch by Kris Ven !)

Moved admin CSS styles to separate CSS file
Updated slovenian language file
Updated dutch language file
Updated french language file (by Pascal Bastien/pascal-gnu)

=========================

1.) New question types

* List type question divided into two question types - radio 
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully. 
  READ THE STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE!!!!

* Question attributes, allows for better control over the display 
and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
