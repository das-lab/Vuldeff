     to resume. PR56333 
     [Artem <artemciy gmail.com>, Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_wstunnel: Honor ProxyWebsocketIdleTimeout in asynchronous
     processing mode. [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_authnz_ldap: Fail explicitly when the filter is too long. Remove
     unnecessary apr_pstrdup() and strlen(). [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap-search option to mod_authnz_ldap, allowing authorization
     to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add the ldap function to the expression API, allowing LDAP filters and
     distinguished names based on expressions to be escaped correctly to

     in other proxy scheme handlers).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_deflate: Add DeflateAlterETag to control how the ETag

  *) mod_authn_file, mod_authn_dbd, mod_authn_dbm, mod_authn_socache:
     Cache the result of the most recent password hash verification for every
