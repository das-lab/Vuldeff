Version 2.0.4 (September 26th, 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * [Security] Prevent moving files by using their directory name.
      [Security] Possible SQL injection for entry category assignment
      [Security] Possible SQL injection for removing&adding a plugin

      All issues require a valid backend login.
      Thanks to Hendrik Buchwald for finding this via their
      RIPS source code analyzer (www.ripstech.com)

    * [Security] Add new configuration option to enable fetching 
      local files for the media uploader. By default this is now
      disabled to prevent Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
      Thanks to Xu Yue for pointing this out!


Version 2.0.3 (January 4th, 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix XSS in backend comment editing form for logged-in authors,
      thanks to Onur Yilmaz and Robert Abela from Netsparker.com

    * Fix some backend entry form related event messages


Version 2.0.2 (Jul 24th, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix security issues reported by Tim Coen of Curesec.com:

      - Forbid uploading files with PHP contents and possible
        PHP execution by authenticated users (critical if
        you have possible untrustworthy authors)
      - Add proper escaping for comment approval tokens to prevent
        SQL injection (authenticated authors only)
      - Add proper escaping of comment's author names in the
        comment reply form to prevent XSS (2k11 template, javascript
        based)

    * Minor layout fixes for media DB media filters

    * Backported some Importer db bugfixes

    * CKEDITOR bugfix releases to 4.4.8 - please read the changelog.
      Includes widget, lineutils, fakeobjects Plugins and S9y added
      cheatsheet and procurator Plugins.
      Changed config.autoParagraph set to false, to prevent wrapping
      p tags around extraAllowedContent tags.

    * Smarty bugfix upgrades to 3.1.27 - please read the changelog.
      Compilation time was vastly improved.
      New Features in NEW_FEATURES.txt.

    * It is now possible to switch to a theme's admin theme if it has
      been selected as a frontend theme first

    * Syndication Plugin Issue #285:
        - Add "none" as possible value for the xml-icon in the
          syndication plugin, to enable plain links
        - Reset subtome full icon path to support
          serendipity_getTemplateFile()
        - Link creation fixes for Bulletproof coloured style (eg blue)

    * Fix auto include of a User theme /admin/user.css backend file.

        PLEASE NOTE:

        2.0.1 brought in an automatted include of a themes "user.css"
        file. If you don't want to use such file any more (and you have
        one), you will have to delete or rename it by hand!

        Also please note, that user stylesheet selectors like

            .selector {
                background-image: url(img/example.jpg);
            }

        now need to use the {TEMPLATE_PATH} like

            .selector {
                background-image: url({TEMPLATE_PATH}img/example.jpg);
            }

        Content of a user.css will always be put LAST into the combined
        CSS, this means it will override any possible plugin output.
        If a user.css file does not exist in your own template directory,
        but inside the default 2k11 template directory, this will always
        be used (this behaviour is called "default fallback chain").

    * Use https URLs for Atom feed, if called through HTTPS (hboeck)

    * Restore the "Show toolbar within media selector popup?" option,
      it was ignored before.

    * Fix Issue #321, negative offset for LIMIT SQL statements when
      using stable archive sorting and plugins like history.

    * Templatechooser will not apply theme in backend admin.

    * Use "secure" flag for (session) cookies sent over SSL, thanks to
      dayton967

    * Make preview_iframe.tpl template files load the proper frontend
      CSS file, including cache-busting version string when changing
      themes

    * Implement patch to properly initiate templates_c on installation
      for shared installs (thanks to fugue88)

    * Allow templatechooser plugin to read a custom "blacklist.txt"
      within its directory, that can blacklist certain themes from
      being selected.

    * Allow serendipity_setCookie() function to set custom expiry.

    * Adapt .htaccess profile of "mod_rewrite for 1&1 and problematic
      servers" to not include the "Options -MultiViews" option, since
      this is often blocked

    * Fix initializing smarty framework in the preview/saving iframe,
      so that a template's config.inc.php is always loaded.

    * Show debugging .tpl file information with relative directory only

    * fix wrong upgrade removal of dead files with 2.0.1 update


Version 2.0.1 (March 12th, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix missing escaping (possible XSS) of category names in the
      Backend Entry Admin, which would allow editors that create a
      forged category name to attack other editors in the backend
      (privileged access to the backend required). Thanks a lot to Edric
      Teo for reporting this issue.

    * Improved detection for possible upgrade/plugin/PHP errors. A
      warning will be emitted on the dashboard, when the Serendipity
      JavaScript library could not be loaded.

    * syndication fix: use absolute urls for subtome

    * Issue 306: localStorage may be deactivated by setting a config
      option or using security-related extensions at least in some
      browsers, which might (at least in FF) break backend JS
      functionality. Added extra tests to 2k11 backend JS.

      If you use localStorage, please test if it is actually available
      by testing if localStorage !== null in JS.

    * Issue 280: Allow every theme to utilize a "user.css" file that
      gets loaded on top of the frontend (or backend, if in admin/
      subdirectory) theme. This file can be used for customized CSS of
      a blog-admin which carries over to future Serendipity updates

    * Issue 299: Do not display dashboard for users with no permission
      to perform actions in the backend (frontend-users)

    * Make "rewriteURL" smarty modifier available to do a
      {$CONST.PATH_ARCHIVE|rewriteURL} within a smarty template file.

    * Add a generic odd/even for backend dashboard widgets to align
      properly. Future dashboard widgets need to get the new extra
      class dashboard widget on the section element they create.

    * Fix event emoticate plugin to reflect proper call usage of
      serendipity_getTemplateFile(), if a theme uses custom emoticons.
      UPDATE your themes emoticons.inc.php file, if have. See example
      file in plugin dir.

    * Change 2k11 config.inc.php to reflect proper
      serendipity_getTemplateFile() when frontend files shall be
      referenced within the backend.

    * Fixed missing file message for deleted media items

    * Fixed entry editor JS not emitting a 'No tags' msg in taxonomy
      quick view. Improved serendipity.tagsList exit if freetag plugin
      is not installed.

    * Minor backend UI fixes (taxonomy quick view in entry editor,
     'Done' msg emitted by Bayes plugin)

    * Clearer language constants for entries in dashboard, labelled
      "In progress"


Version 2.0 (January 23rd, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Smarty fix for purging compiled files

    * Fix wrong search page ordering when stable archive was active

    * Prevent entryproperties from saving/displaying a browser-side
      stored password that was actually not set.

    * Stronger check for existing logger interface to prevent errors
      when it is not actively used.

    * Fix entryproperties being removed when publishing an article
      from the dashboard and by specific plugins (freetag, trackback)
      that modify entry data.

    * Fix deleting comments when user is not an admin, but the entry
      belongs to him. Thanks to berberic.

    * Patch PEAR.php to use "static" isError declaration to prevent
      PHP error messages

    * Change order of IF-statements in entries.tpl to check for
      comment_moderate/comment_added, to properly emit the message
      whether a comment is being moderated.

    * Fix searching for entries in the admin panel with database
      types other than "mysql"

    * Change entry editor's category assignment to toggle between
      a hierarchical and a plain list (good for many categories)

    * Fix date formatting in entry editor to not use ISO year
      but the calendar year

    * Fix autoupdate version read and transmit


Version 2.0-rc2 (December 23rd, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixes escaping of comments in the new backend pane to prevent
      XSS. Thanks to Steffen Röemann for reporting!

    * Fix wrong parameter count in serendipity_entity_decode


Version 2.0-rc1 (includes beta4/5/6) (December 19th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * entryproperties plugin will now automatically disable nl2br
      markup, when the WYSIWYG editor is used to create en entry

    * PHP Requirement now is at: PHP 5.3+

    * Fix for syndication subtome onclick handler

    * Fix problematic preview stylesheet reference

    * Optimized clearing smarty template files on upgrading

    * Properly reset the "disable markup" feature of entryproperties
      plugin when none selected

    * PHP 5.4+ fix to properly call htmlspecialchars() / htmlentities() /
      html_entity_decode() with a charset option, that has been
      set to to default to UTF-8 and will yield empty strings when
      being used in NON-UTF-8 environments. Now we utilize a
      serendipity_specialchars() wrapper call.

    * Added SQLite3 OO database layer for PHP 5.4+

    * New personal preference to choose CKEditor toolbar presets.
      Presets can be overwritte through a
      templates/xxx/admin/ckeditor_custom_config.js if needed.
      See htmlarea/ckeditor_s9y_config.js for details.

    * Proof of concept templates "default-php" and "default-xml" have
      been moved to Siber...Spartacus. They would need adapting to
      Serendipity 2.0 (simple methods like getConfigDir() et al),
      but since those Template APIs have virtually zero usage scenario,
      they remain experimental.

    * Added new PAT_JS mod_rewrite rule to .htaccess files

    * Removed experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN-MEMORY caching
      added in 2.0-beta3, since this could not work.

    * Smarty 3.1.21 upgrade (see changelog)

    * Fix ImageMagick new sizing issues while forcing image geometry
      exactly to given sizes with imageselectorplus

    * Fix issue #220 with pdf directory moving rename() error

    * Fix bug in entry listing, which showed wrong categories for
      entries (Issue #201)

    * Improve RegExp for Feed-URL matching, thanks to fugue88

    * Proper SQLite PDO filenames in shared installations (Issue #214)

    * ImageMagick now can get parameters to generate thumbnails,
      see serendipity_config.inc.php for example values

    * Allow to enable/disable the new autosave feature in personal
      preferences (Issue #213)

    * Re-added installer test for writable serendipity base directory


Version 2.0-beta3 (July 25th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Move admin/media_showitem.tpl to theme's directory in 2k11. With
      an adaptation in serendipity_admin_image_selector.php, this now is
      a "true" frontend template which uses the styles of the frontend
      theme. Theme authors might want to adapt it to their themes.

    * Moved general syndication plugin option into the core

    * Smarty 3.1.19 upgrade (see changelog)

    * Fixed thumbnail recreation, Issue #134

    * Merged external JS libraries into a central "plugins.js" of the 2k11
      backend template, can be updated through
      templates/2k11/admin/js/gruntipity.php helper script.

    * Adapted database table structure change for statistics, shoutbox,
      karma and spamblock plugin (for new field definition of "ip" field)
      Thanks to rohdef!

    * Added new option "enabledBackendPopups" that allow to specify
      if inline modal dialogs or popups are used in the backend for
      e.g. the category selectory and media library

    * added experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN MEMORY caching
      Enabled by default, if classes found loaded.
      Disable with
        $serendipity['disable_apc'] = true;
      and
        $serendipity['disable_memcache'] = true;

    * Support added in serendipity_db_schema_import for sqlite
      autoincrement

    * Remove Google Reader button from syndication plugin options

    * Add subToMe-button to syndication plugin and change its defaults

    * Use Browsercache to save cache and restore entries

    * Improved installer to forbid using database table prefixes with
      special characters

    * Themes using Engines are now able to use the parent's
      configuration

    * Prevent "new" plugin api to install double instances of plugins
      that are not stackable (issue #45)

    * Back button in plugin-config

    * Adapted serendipity_editor.js to provide more global (though
      deprecated) API access methods for plugins like amazonchooser
      and linktrimmer, to perform insertion. Also fixed the
      insertion of text when the ID of the element is not prefixed

    * Move sort by name to simple filter in ML, replace file extension

    * Remember selected media library folder

    * Show upload-success or error with the ajax image uploader

    * Fix preview entry exception (issue #119)

    * Add serendipity.toggle_collapsible as a reusable JS function
      for the core backend and backend sections emitted by plugins as
      an easy way to provide show/hide functionality. (yellowled)

    * Fixed media insert target bug (issued by #143, #145, #121)

    * Fixed publish drafted-entries via dashboard (issue #160)

    * All frontend themes that rely on the bundled Core jQuery library
      are currently using the jquery.noConflict-mode for compatibility
      to older plugins.
      This mode is now considered deprecated and will be removed in
      future releases. A new variable:
        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery-noconflict'] = false;
      in your theme's config.inc.php file can now turn of that
      noConflict-mode.

    * Due to distinction of backend and frontend themes, each theme
      that provides a custom jquery.js now only does so for the
      frontend. The backend now listens to a:

        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery_backend'] = false;

      variable, and the file needs to be jquery_backend.js that
      a backend theme would reference to.

    * Changed 2k11's config.inc.php file to provide a more stable
      call of event hooks so that other themes can also hook
      their own events.

    * Changed JS for category filtering and its reset button to be a
      reusable function, which is now also used in the list of
      installable plugins.

    * Fixed wrong local documentation URL in plugin configuration

    * Added new "backend_dashboard" event-hook for plugins to use
      within dashboard.

    * Backend and Frontend themes can now be set independently from
      each other. New backend themes now need to set:

        Backend: Yes

      in their info.txt file. If you adapt a custom admin theme,
      ensure that it is compatible to the new "2k11" backend to
      ensure proper future usage within Serendipity. The bulletproof
      backend will now no longer be recognized as a backend theme
      option, but can be selected as a new frontend theme, while
      using 2k11 (=default) in the backend.

    * Include klogger, call it as $serendipity['logger']->debug/error.
      The log-level can be set in the general configuration and is
      disabled by default.

    * Fixed missing s9ymdb ID

    * Add HTTP_Request2 and dependencies as bundled libraries and
      update PEAR library to version 1.9.4

    * Implemented AJAX uploadResize option to allow resizing an image
      before upload (onli)

    * Improved file/directory removal code to (hopefully) fail more
      gracefully

    * Change "default" admin backend template fallback chain so that
      old admin themes can theoretically be shown with the "old"
      admin interface. This however in many themes breaks the
      Serendipity workflow. In other words, currently old custom backend
      themes are deprecated. We are still working on how to deal
      with this and if we can add some sort of compatibility or port.

    * Fix bundled jquery's source mapping, upgraded to 1.11.1

    * Fixed missing media name in resize GET URL

    * Fix MediaDB overlay display

    * Re-Added possibility to change filename/target directory for
      media uploads

    * Update CKEditor to 4.4

    * Fixed some missing internationalization instances

    * Minor CSS improvements for upgrader, plugin sequencing widget

    * RSS importer accepts pubDate in addition to pubdate element.

    * Upgrader in Dashboard can be disabled, returns error message when
      URL not accessible

    * Added a category filtering ability for the entry editor

    * Better check when removing old/dead files to prevent error
      messages

    * WYSIWYG editor respects image floats

    * Support html5 multiple file upload

    * Modernizr, magnificPopup updates

    * Improvements to equal heights js, button labels

    * No longer truncate long entry titles

    * Improve non-WYSIWYG editor tag insertion, url insertion

    * Improve less DOM firing on certain javascript tasks

    * Introduce js_backend event hook


Version 2.0-beta1 and followup -beta2 (April 14th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Upgrade Smarty libs to 3.1.18

    * Automatic upgrade removal of old Smarty2 files (2.0-alpha2)
      function uses SPL

    * Implemented patch https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/pull/15

    * When switching Themes, both the backend and the frontend
      will remember the timestamp of the last theme change,
      to make sure that the browser will not cache a mismatching CSS.

    * Fix theme change issues with global template vars in core
      (1559472ca3) see 'temporary added empty $template_config_groups'
      in 1.7-rc2 (eb77dc369a)

    * Use Smarty for backend display output

    * "Themes" are now what has previously been mixed as "Design",
      "Theme", "Template" or "Layouts".

    * WYSIWYG-Spawn-API reworked (2k11/admin/wysiwyg_init.tpl)

    * All Javascript-functions like SetCookie now reside in a
      serendipity-object, simulating a namespace.
        SetCookie(...)
      became
        serendipity.SetCookie(...)

    * Renamed JS-Function:
        toggleCategorySelector became toggle_category_selector

    * The advanced js option (eyecandy) got removed, as such a thing
      like advanced js doesn't exist anymore

    * dashboard_plugin has an equivalent in the core, replacing the
      frontpage

    * Constants like S9Y_FRAMEWORK_COMPAT are no longer set
      (include_once is used instead)

    * New additional option to render smarty-functions:
      serendipity_smarty_show($template, $data)

    * A number of functions now returns their result instead of echoing
      them (TODO: a bunch of image- and
      trackback-functions still use echo for messages"):
        serendipity_plugin_config
        serendipity_printEntryForm
        serendipity_printEntries
        function serendipity_showMedia
        serendipity_showPropertyForm
        showMediaLibrary
        serendipity_guessInput
        memSnap
        serendipity_displayTopUrlList
        serendipity_displayTopExits
        serendipity_displayTopReferrers
        serendipity_printConfigTemplate
        show_plugins

    * Functions removed from the core:
        serendipity_printConfigJS

    * Functions added to the core:
        serendipity_generateImageSelectorParams

    * All internal plugins got extracted from plugin_internal.inc.php
      and moved to plugins/.
      They are renamed to work there (upgrader task provides migration):
        serendipity_calendar_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_calendar
        serendipity_quicksearch_plugin became serendipity_plugin_quicksearch
        serendipity_archives_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_archives
        serendipity_categories_plugin  became serendipity_plugin_categories
        serendipity_syndication_plugin became serendipity_plugin_syndication
        serendipity_superuser_plugin   became serendipity_plugin_superuser
        serendipity_plug_plugin        became serendipity_plugin_plug

    * Add plugin hook "js", generating a virtual serendipity.js

    * Admin JS is now bundled in serendipity_editor.js.tpl and
      rendered using smarty in the theme config

    * Admin JS got rewritten using jQuery where applicable

    * serendipity_define.js.php removed

    * Removed support for layout.php

    * The whole PHP-Code now almost never echoes integrated HTML, but
      uses smarty template (TODO: Remove the almost)
      The necessary smarty-templates reside in 2k11/admin/
      Every theme can generate its own backend if it integrates those
      templates under admin/ itself

    * 2k11 is set as the new default backend, replacing bulletproof.
      default remains the fallback so far.

    * A number of functions had some arguments removed:
        * function serendipity_displayImageList:
            From
                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL, $smarty_display = true)
            to
                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL)
        * function serendipity_showMedia
            From
                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array(), $smarty_display = true)
            to
                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array())
        * generate_plugins
            From
                static function generate_plugins($side, $tag = '', $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')
            to
                static function generate_plugins($side, $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')

    * serendipity_showMedia now no longer returns the used template and
      echoes the generated HTML, but only returns the generated HTML

    * Themes now have their own configuration page,
      ?serendipity[adminModule]=templates&serendipity[adminAction]=editConfiguration

    * jQuery in the backend no longer runs in noConflict-mode. Use
      $(...) instead of jQuery(...)

    * The entryproperty-plugin will now always delete its cache on
      uninstall, not only if the cache is activated then

    * serendipity_is_iframe now really only checks for iframe and
      doesn't also echo it

    * Added option simpleFilters (meant to indicate to show less
      filters and poweruser-options)

    * serendipity_admin_image_selector.php no longer used by 2k11,
      instead the media library (with admin/media_choose.tpl,
      admin/media_upload.tpl, media_pane.tpl, media_items.tpl)
      can generat the imageselector on its own. The editor calls
      serendipity_admin.php?serendipity[adminModule]=media instead,
      with serendipity[textarea] indicating the target, and
      serendipity[showMediaToolbar] activating the imageSelector modus

    * New required PHP-Version: 5.3 or higher (checked in the installer)


Version 1.7.8 (February 9th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed POST for db entry insert, caused by 1.7.6 security feature


Version 1.7.7 (February 6th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed PHP parse error in templatechooser plugin. Blame garvin. :(


Version 1.7.6 (February 6th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed backend security issues, thanks to Stefan Schurtz:

        - XSS of users realname in "Manage users" section
          (Backend, requires login)
        - XSS when creating an entry with bad id/timestamp values
          (Backend, requires login)
        - SQL-Injection for plugin installation parameter
          (Backend, requires admin login)

    * Templatechooser plugin uses "default" template as fallback,
      not "bulletproof".


Version 1.7.5 (January 18th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed textile PHP 5.2 (namespace) compat issue

    * Added default value to spamblocks required_fields option [name,
      comment]


Version 1.7.4 (January 11th, 2014)

    * rc4: Fixed fetching javascript object (for nugget textareas) in non-wysiwyg-mode

    * rc4: Change .htaccess blocking mechanism by spamblock plugin to not fetch
      too many datarows, thanks to DLange from the forums. (The .htaccess
      feature is still considered experimental, use at your own risk ;))

    * rc4: Fixed entryproperties backend 'cache now' link

    * rc3 + rc4: Media database: Escape more Cookie values to prevent storing
      possible XSS (http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19142).
      Escape hotlinked media filename. Escape importer host name error
      Thanks to GreenSun from the forums for bringing this to attention,
      originally reported by Dshellnoi Unix

    * rc2: Alter entries.tpl to add the line:
      {assign var="entry" value=$entry scope="parent"}
      for proper propagation of $entry to sub-templates.

    * rc2: Alter error reporting to only fail when 'debug' mode is enabled,
      so that "normal" blog installations will not fail on specific
      E_STRICT warnings that are not important.

    * rc2: temporary added empty $template_config_groups into templates with config,
      to avoid display troubles for template changes, if previous template had these set.
      Please check your template.

    * rc2: reflect POST submitted changes in Bulletproof template configs re-set situations

    * various PHP 5 compatibility fixes in core and plugins

    * Allow entryproperties plugin to define defaults for custom fields

    * Onyx, Net_URL classes: Remove PHP4 style constructor due to
      PHP5 error "Constructor already defined"

    * Improved RSS sidebarplugin to support Atom

    * Bundled simplepie

    * For Blogs running on a non-UTF-8 language, set a Smarty constant
      to indicate the actually used charset.

    * Added to use MyISAM handler for s9y tables (we do not use InnoDB
      features, but rely on MyISAM fulltext)

    * fixed defaultBaseURL did not show up installer. Thanks to onli.
      Follow up from c292bad

    * fixed draft & future entries preview link in backend

    * Improved karmarating plugin to be able to use AJAX calls
      (gregman)

    * Allow Smarty to fetch .tpl files from all directories so that
      s9y plugin can use the fetch() call for their .tpl files no
      matter which (symlinked) directory the plugin resides in.
      The Smarty security policy to us only serves as a restriction
      within .tpl files to not allow arbitrary PHP modifier/function calls.
      If in the future Smarty supports enforcing trustedDir checks on
      {include} calls seperately to smarty->fetch() calls, we'll also
      add that to .tpl files.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Patch by Markus Brükner: Properly handle files that have no
      extension in media database

    * Made Spartacus recognize github.com mirror (garvinhicking)

    * Add "Summary" output to title of summary archive pages, patch by
      hboeck

    * Set the smarty object by instance (ophian)
      It is often needed to access the Smarty object from anywhere in your code, e.g. in plugins
      We now ensure that there is only one instance of the object available.
      To obtain an instance of this class: $serendipity['smarty'] = Serendipity_Smarty::getInstance();
      The first time this is called a new instance will be created. Thereafter, the same instance is handed back.
      To overwrite use $serendipity['smarty'] = new Serendipity_Smarty; to create a new instance.

    * Set a global Serendipity errorToExceptionHandler (ophian)
      changed some old smarty trigger_errors to PHPs native function

    * Updated spamblock plugin (ophian)
      changed wordfilter to function and Commenters moderation check verify_once
      to get checked via wordfilter to reject known spam comments before

    * Changed backend comment (error) messages  (ophian)
      as now captured and styleable messages
      (newly added .serendipity_backend_msg_notice css class)

    * Updated nl2br plugin (ophian)
      added isolation tag using nl to br
      this also adds some NoBR buttons to backend entry forms

    * Smarty3 support (ophian)
      with this upgrade Serendipity / Smarty will at least need a webserver running the PHP 5.2 series.
      As of August 2011, all PHP users should note, that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore by the PHP developers.
      All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.8 and up. Please refer to your ISP about this.

    * Added new serendipity['defaultBaseURL'] variable that makes sure
      that the baseURL is not overriden when configuring serendipity
      with a possibly autodetected currentl URL. Patch by Manko10.
