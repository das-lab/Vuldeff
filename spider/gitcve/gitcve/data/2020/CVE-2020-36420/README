Polipo is obsolete
==================

When it was first written, Polipo was probably the best HTTP proxy
available.  Since then, the web protocols have changed, and Polipo hasn't
kept up -- it has no support for HTTP/2.0 or the WebSocket protocol.

Polipo will no longer be maintained.


Original Polipo README
======================

Polipo is single-threaded, non blocking caching web proxy that has
very modest resource needs.  See the file INSTALL for installation
instructions.  See the texinfo manual (available as HTML after
installation) for more information.

Current information about Polipo can be found on the Polipo web page,
