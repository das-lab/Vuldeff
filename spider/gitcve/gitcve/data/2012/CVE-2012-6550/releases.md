### Zero Clipboard 1.0.7 Released

Zero Clipboard 1.0.7 can now copy **Rich HTML** to the clipboard. When this is pasted into an application that supports rich text, it will show up as fully rendered HTML (not the source that was copied). Since this feature only works in Flash Player 10, it is opt-in, and must be specifically enabled in your code. See the updated [Instructions](https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard/blob/master/docs/instructions.md) for details. Thanks to jpp at cloudview for the patch!

### Zero Clipboard 1.0.5 Released

Zero Clipboard 1.0.5 can now glue the Flash movie to a relatively positioned parent element (instead of the page body), resulting in perfect positioning of the movie on top of your copy button. This also allows you to use Zero Clipboard inside overflow:auto or position:fixed elements.

The [Instructions](https://github.com/jonrohan/ZeroClipboard/blob/master/docs/instructions.md) have been updated with details on how to use the new feature. The API is 100% backward compatible with previous versions.
