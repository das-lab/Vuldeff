### Donations
* I spent most of my free time creating, updating, maintaining and supporting these plugins, if you really love my plugins and could spare me a couple of bucks, I will really appericiate it. If not feel free to use it without any obligations.

### Disclaimer
* Note that this plugin passes your datababase password via --password in the command line of mysqldump. This is convenient but as a trade off, it is insecure.
* On some systems, your password becomes visible to system status programs such as ps that may be invoked by other users to display command lines. MySQL clients typically overwrite the command-line password argument with zeros during their initialization sequence. However, there is still a brief interval during which the value is visible. Also, on some systems this overwriting strategy is ineffective and the password remains visible to ps.

* If this is a concern to you, I recommend another database backup plugin called [WP-DB-Backup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-db-backup/)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### My database is not backed up / My backup file is 0Kb
* Ensure that your host allows you to access mysqldump. You can try to narrow the problem by Debugging via SSH:
1. In `wp-dbmanager.php`
2. Find `check_backup_files();` on line 210
3. Add below it `echo $command;`
4. Go to `WP-Admin -> Database -> Backup`
5. Click `Backup`
6. It should print some debugging statements
7. Copy that line than run it in SSH
8. If you need help on SSH contact your host or google for more info

### What is the difference between WP-DBManager and WP-DB-Backup?
* WP-DBManager uses `mysqldump` application to generate the backup and `mysql` application to restore them via shell.
* WP-DB-Backup uses PHP to generate the backup. In some cases WP-DB-Backup will work better for you because it requires less permissions. Not all host allows you to access mysqldump/mysql directly via shell.
* WP-DBManager allows you to have automatic optimizing and repairing of database on top of backing up of database.

### Why do I get the message "Warning: Your backup folder MIGHT be visible to the public!"?
* Ensure that you have renamed `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess` and placed it in your backup folder (defaults to `wp-content/backup-db/`)
* If you are 100% sure you have did that and have verfied that the folder no longer is accessible to the public by visiting the URL `http://yousite.com/wp-content/backup-db/`, you can safely disable the notice by going to `WP-Admin -> Database -> DB Options` and set `Hide Admin Notices` to `Yes`.
