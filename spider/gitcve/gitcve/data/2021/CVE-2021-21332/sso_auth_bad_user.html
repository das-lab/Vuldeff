                We were unable to validate your <tt>{{server_name | e}}</tt> account via
                single-sign-on (SSO), because the SSO Identity Provider returned
                different details than when you logged in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try the operation again, and ensure that you use the same details on
                the Identity Provider as when you log into your account.
