        - This release contains many substantial changes that are not
          backwards compatible, but good news is that it's also the last
          major feature breaking release before 1.0. ;)
          Older releases of Mojo did contain additional Mojo::Script::* and
          Mojolicious::Script::* modules that are obsolete now and might
          break this version if they are still present on your system.
          Because of this we highly suggest that you
          DELETE ALL MODULES IN THE "Mojo", "MojoX" AND "Mojolicious"
          NAMESPACES MANUALLY!!!
        - Mojo::Script has been renamed to Mojo::Command, this change is not
          backwards compatible!
          You will have to regenerate application scripts or replace
          "Mojo(licious)::Script" with "Mojo(licious)::Command" manually.
        - Removed unused features from Mojo::Base and simplified API, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              __PACKAGE__->attr('foo', default => 'bar');
          becomes
              __PACKAGE__->attr(foo => 'bar');
        - Merged eplite and epl, this change is not backwards compatible, you
          will have to rename all your eplite templates to epl.
        - Simplified MojoX::Renderer, this change is not backwards
          compatible!
          Handler can no longer be detected, that means "default_handler" or
          the "handler" argument are required.
          The template argument can no longer contain format or handler.
              $self->render(template => 'foo.html.epl')
          becomes
              $self->render('foo', format => 'html', handler => 'epl')
          The following forms are available now.
              $self->render;
              $self->render(controller => 'foo', action => 'bar');
              $self->render({controller => 'foo', action => 'bar'});
              $self->render(text => 'Hello!');
              $self->render(template => 'index');
              $self->render(template => 'foo/index');
              $self->render(
                  template => 'index',
                  format   => 'html',
                  handler  => 'epl'
              );
              $self->render(handler => 'something');
              $self->render('foo/bar');
              $self->render('foo/bar', format => 'html');
              $self->render('foo/bar', {format => 'html'});
          For renderers the stash will no longer get an updated template,
          instead a new argument will be passed along.
              {template => 'foo/bar', format => 'html', handler => 'epl'}
        - Simplified context and controller in Mojolicious, this change is
          not backwards compatible!
          If you've been using a custom context object you'll now have to use
          a custom controller base class.
          The new controller_class attribute can now be used to set the
          default controller in Mojolicious.
          There is also no $c argument anymore actions get called with, since
          everything is in $self now.
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Transaction and Mojo::Pipeline, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              Mojo::Transaction -> Mojo::Transaction::Single
              Mojo::Pipeline -> Mojo::Transaction::Pipeline
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::File and Mojo::File::Memory, this
          change is not backwards compatible!
              Mojo::File -> Mojo::Asset::File
              Mojo::File::Memory -> Mojo::Asset::Memory
        - Refactored and renamed Mojo::Content, this change is not backwards
          compatible!
