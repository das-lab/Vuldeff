<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The ini agent is a common agent to read a variety of ini files.
The main purpose for this agent were configuration files for samba
(/etc/samba.conf).</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p class="notimpl">Texts like this mean that described feature will
be implemented later. (That means when all other features are
implemented.)</p>

<h3 id="entities">Ini file entities</h3>

<p>The agent sees an ini file as containing these basic entities:
entries, sections and comments. <b>Entries</b> have a name and a
value and an optional comment. <b>Sections</b> have a name and can
contain entries or other sections (TODO comments?). Entries and
Sections may be of multiple kinds. (Different kinds of sections are
useful for lilo.conf which distinguishes "image" and "other"
sections. Different kinds of entries are currently used as a kludge
to cope with single quoted, double quoted and unquoted values.)
This general view can be restricted by some options (TODO
link).</p>

<p>Ini file agent is line-oriented. It means that it reads input
line-by-line and each line is processed separately. If it is
required, line may continue to the next line using \ as the last
character of the line. Such lines are read at once and combined
into one string before further processing. See also the option <a
href="#line_can_continue">line_can_continue</a>.</p>

<p>Generalized ini file may look like this:</p>

<pre>
Comment
Key=Value
Key=Value
Comment
Begin-section-delimiter name
  Key=Value
  Key=Value
  Begin-sub-section-delimiter name
    Key=Value
    Key=Value
  End-sub-section-delimiter name
End-section-delimiter name
</pre>

<p>In most ini files there are no subsections. Classical ini file
has no End-section-delimiter (and therefore it may have no
subsections). In most ini files there are no Key/Values at the
top-level. Definitely section name may be the same as key name. But
maybe for some ini files, there may be more keys with the same name
or more sections with the same name.</p>

<h3 id="patterns">Patterns</h3>

<p>Lets use regular expressions to find out what kind of line we
are processing. We need regular expression to read and recognize
line and a pattern-string to write anything back to file.
Example:<br />
To recognize section beginning we may use:<br />
<tt>^\[([a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+)\]</tt><br />
Such section delimiter must start at the first column. Its name may
contain <tt>[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]</tt>. No spaces are allowes. Pattern for
write may be:<br />
 <tt>[%s]</tt><br />
There is no need to \n at the end of pattern. As mentioned above,
agent is line-oriented so it writes \n automaticaly after each line
shipped out.<br />
</p>

<p>Comments in ini files must occupy whole line by default. When
they do not we have a small problem. Should we remove comments at
first or process value at first? Example:<br />
Values must be quoted by " and comments are delimited by #<br />
 Key = "Value # anything"<br />
How will we understand this? Anyway it is solvable. There will be
option that switches between 3 states:</p>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#comments_last">comments_last</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Default) At first, comments are stripped of, then [key, value]
are parsed.</li>

<li>At first, [key, value] then comments are parsed.</li>

<li>Comments may be single on line only.</li>
</ul>

Note: Comments starting from the beginning of line always have the
top priority.<br />
<br />
 
<p>There may be Begin-section and End-section delimiter. Section
end delimiter is not mandatory, but when there are no section
delimiters, then there are no nested sections. We must specify,
whether nested sections may be used. Default is: autodetect (which
means, subsections are allowed if End-section delimiter is
defined). We must say if toplevel values (not belonging to any
section) are allowed. We might have more types of section
delimiters.</p>

<p>There is only one problem with values. They may be by accident
divided to more lines (without usage of backslash). Then we must
detect if this is value that will continue on the next line. We
will restrict this feature only to values that are quoted.</p>

<blockquote>Of course it is possible to detect separated lines also
in case no delimiters are used. It would mean to define regexp that
detects that current line is not continuing line (so it would
detect comments, empty lines, key=value pairs and section
delimiters). But I believe we do not need it.</blockquote>

<h3 id="config">Configuration file for ini files</h3>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
`IniAgent ("/file/name",
$[
  "<a href="#params">params</a>" : [
    $[
      "<a href="#match">match</a>" :     [ "regexp", "pattern" ],
      "<a

         ...
  ],
  "<a
href="#options">options</a>"  : [ "option1", "option2", ... ]],
    ...
  ]
]
</pre>

<pre>
`IniAgent (<i>File specification</i>, <i>Configuration map</i>)
</pre>

<h4 id="filespec">File Specification:</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Single file mode</dt>

<dd>In most cases you will specify single file here as a
string.</dd>

<dt id="multiple-files">Multiple files mode</dt>

<dd>If you specify list of file specifications (that may contain
wildcards), these filenames are used as section names and content
is read "into" corresponding sections. Please keep in mind, that in
this mode you may create files as well! If you do <tt>Write
(.....s.new_section, "#comment\n");</tt> then when saving new file
<tt>new_section</tt> is created.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You should use absolute paths or you will have to take extereme
care not to cd in your program :-)</p>

<p>See also the option <a href="#read_only">read_only</a>.</p>

<h4 id="configmap">Configuration map</h4>

<h4 id="params">Params:</h4>

<p>The most important item in the configuratin map is
<b>params</b>. It specifies how entries are parsed and written.
Recall that there may be several kinds of entries, so params is a
list. Each param is a map with a mandatory "match" item and an
optional "multiline" item.</p>

<p id="match">"<b>match</b>" items are input-output pairs: The
first pair item is an extended regular expression contatining two
subexpressions ("...(...)...(...)..."), the name and the value of
the entry. It is used at parse time. The second pair item is a
printf format string containing two %s placeholders for the name
and the value. (TODO check how integers are handled. Misquote on
output?)</p>

<p>Format of regexps: glibc regexps will be used. Hence the regexp
format must be understood by glibc. (try man 7 regex). See also the
option <a href="#ignore_case_regexps">ignore_case_regexps</a>.</p>

<p>See also the options <a
href="#prefer_uppercase">prefer_uppercase</a> and <a
href="#first_upper">first_upper</a>.</p>

<p id="multiline">"<b>multiline</b>" : [ "begin_re", "end_re"
]<br />
 - if there may be values spread over more than one line this
should define its parsing. Please note that main purpose for this
are lines broken by accident, for example if some editor breaks
longer lines. Example:</p>

<pre>
      Key="value value
      still value
      still value"
</pre>

<p>Then begin regexp is: ([^=]+)="([^"]*) and end regexp is
([^"]"). These are compared at the end so they are the last
possibility. But once we get into this "divided line" by accident,
it becomes greedy, so be carefull to forgotten ". If "multiline" is
not present, this mechanism does not take in effect of course.</p>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#join_multiline">join_multiline</a>.</p>

<div class="notimpl">"names" : [list]<br />
- list of allowed names<br />
- now list may contain only strings. Maybe it will be enriched to
regexps too.</div>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#global_values">global_values</a>.</p>

<h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4>

<p>A list of regular expressions to check. Note that if you combine
all expressions that identify string into one, you will have faster
processing. If you allow comments not starting at the first colunm,
you must add "[ \t]*" before comment regexp. If you want to allow
only comments on single line, prepend ^ before regexp.</p>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#no_finalcomment_kill">no_finalcomment_kill</a>.</p>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#comments_last">comments_last</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sections">Sections:</h4>

<p>There may be more sections defined under the key "sections" to
allow more types of section beginnings/ends, so this is a list.
Each list item is a map with a mandatory "begin" pair and an
optional "end" pair.</p>

<p>"begin": ["regexp", "pattern"]<br />
 - regexp to find section begin and pattern to write section
begin</p>

<p>"end" : ["regexp", "pattern"]<br />
 - ...</p>

<p>See also the options <a
href="#prefer_uppercase">prefer_uppercase</a> and <a
href="#first_upper">first_upper</a>.</p>

<div class="notimpl">"names" : [list]<br />
- list of allowed names<br />
- now list may contain only strings. Maybe it will be enriched to
regexps too.<br />
</div>

<p>See also the option <a
href="#no_nested_sections">no_nested_sections</a>.</p>

<h4 id="subindent">Subindent:</h4>

<p>This string will be added before each data line in subsections. If
you want to have indented subsections, use this.</p>

<p>Example: "subindent" : " ", or "subindent" : "\t".</p>

<!-- bug 74698 -->
<p>Formerly the comments were indented too but it turns out that
there are some configuration files that allow indenting data but
not comments. Also the comment indentation would grow endlessly.</p>

<h4 id="options">Options:</h4>

<dl>
<dt id="ignore_case_regexps">"ignore_case_regexps":</dt>

<dd>case is not significant when processing regexps.</dd>

<dt id="ignore_case">"ignore_case":</dt>

<dd>case is not significant when reading keys/section names.
Does not work with <a href="#multiple-files">multiple files</a>.</dd>

<dt id="first_upper">"first_upper"</dt>

<dd>if "ignore_case", save first letter upper and the other lower
in keys and sections</dd>

<dt id="prefer_uppercase">"prefer_uppercase"</dt>

<dd>if "ignore_case", save keys and sections in upper case</dd>

<dt id="line_can_continue">"line_can_continue"</dt>

<dd>if line ends with backslash it continues on the next line</dd>

<dt id="no_nested_sections">"no_nested_sections"</dt>

<dd>nested sections are forbidden and reported as error in log
file</dd>

<dt id="global_values">"global_values"</dt>

<dd>values at the top level are allowed</dd>

<dt id="repeat_names">"repeat_names"</dt>

<dd>there may be more keys with the same name and more sections
with the same name. Note that sections with the same name as keys
are allowed.<br />
This option also disables merging of data if the file
is <a href="#finally">modified</a> externally.</dd>

<dt id="comments_last">"comments_last"</dt>

<dd>line is parsed first for single-line comments, then for
[key,value] and finally for additional comment. This comment is
moved above the [key,value] pair</dd>

<dt id="join_multiline">"join_multiline"</dt>

<dd>multiline values (parsed by "params":"multiline") are connected
into one using a space character.</dd>

<dt id="no_finalcomment_kill">"no_finalcomment_kill"</dt>

<dd>do not kill empty spaces at the end of last comment</dd>

<dt id="read_only">"read_only"</dt>

<dd>does not write file at the end</dd>

<dt id="flat">"flat"</dt>

<dd>special mode for files with flat structure -- only values
without sections. Read/Write/Dir commands work without need to
specify what to read (key/section) because everything is key.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="rewrite">rewrite</h4>

<p>This list takes in effect only if multiple files are specified.
There are rules for rewriting file name to section name and pattern
back from the section name to file name. Example:</p>

<pre>
"rewrite" : [
    [ "/etc/sysconfig/network/isdn/(*)$",  "/etc/sysconfig/network/isdn/%s", ],
    [ "/etc/sysconfig/network/modem/(*)$", "/etc/sysconfig/network/modem/%s", ],
],
</pre>

<p>If filename of the processed file matches the pattern, its first
subpattern is taken as a section name. When saving the section,
filename is created as <tt>printf(pattern, section_name)</tt>.
First rewrite rule that matches is used for file name to section
name mapping. If file name doesn't match to any rule it is let
untouched.<br />
Be extremly careful when using rewrite rules. There are 2 possible
caveats.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write pattern doesn't correspond to regular expression. In this
case you will have a new file you didn't wish after write.</li>

<li>When creating new top-level section, specify also index of
rewrite rule that should be used for writting the section. If you
do not specify it, it will default to 0, which could be OK but
needn't.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sysconfig">Configuration file for sysconfig files (former rc files)</h3>

<p>Ini agent may be easily used for parsing files in sysconfig
directory, but care must be taken to keep the files clean. No such
mess as in rc.config is allowed. Please do not place bash code into
sysconfig files. Only key="value". Nothing else.</p>

<pre>
# comment

.mount.path
`ag_ini(
        `SysConfigFile (filename)
)
</pre>

<p>A SysConfigFile call is just a shortcut to an IniAgent call. The
equivalent IniAgent is:</p>

<pre>
`IniAgent (filename,
    $[
        "options" : [ "line_can_continue", "global_values", "join_multiline", "comments_last", "flat", ],
        "comments": [ "^[ \t]*#.*$", "#.*", "^[ \t]*$", ],
        "params" : [
            $[
                "match" : [ "([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)[ \t]*=[ \t]*\"([^\"]*)\"", "%s=\"%s\"" ],
                "multiline" : [ "([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)[ \t]*=[ \t]*\"([^\"]*)", "([^\"]*)\"", ],
            ],
            $[
                "match" : [ "([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)[ \t]*=[ \t]*([^\"]*[^ \t\"]|)[ \t]*$", "%s=\"%s\"",],
            ],
        ],
])
</pre>

<h2 id="ycp-interface">Interface for ini-agent</h2>

Assume, agent is mounted on path .ini 
<h3 id="access">Accessing keys</h3>

<p>Because ini file structure may be hierarchical and there can be
sections and keys with any name, we must use some keyword to
distinguish between key/sections/comments. Paths will look like
this:<br />
</p>

<table border="1" summary="ini paths">
<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.value.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>key</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies value that belongs to key.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.value_comment.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>key</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies comment that belongs to key.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.value_type.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>key</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies type of the key, which is the index of rule this key
was read by.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.section.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies section key.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.section_comment.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies comment that belongs to section key.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>.ini.section_type.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies type of the section, which is the index of rule this
section was read by.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="notimpl">
<td>
<tt>.ini.section_file.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i></tt></td>
<td>identifies type of the section, which is the index of <a
href="#rewrite">rewrite</a> rule this section was read by.<br />
(So far, this is accessed by section_type if there are rewrite
rules. Yuck.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>.ini.all.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i></tt><br />
<tt>.ini.all</tt></td>
<td>Accesses all the contents of a section or the whole file at
once.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Abbreviations <tt>v,s,vc,sc,vt,st,<span
class="notimpl">sf</span></tt> are allowed. Imagine what happens if
we decide not to use these prefixed indentifiers. If there is
section S1 with subsection comment, then we would not know what
.ini.S1.comment means. <br />
These paths work with <b>Read</b> and <b>Dir</b>. <b>Write</b> is a
special case. You may write new values and their comments. You may
write new sections and their comments. But when you write section,
section name is encoded in path, so parameter passed to
<b>Write</b> is always understood as comment.<br />
All <b>Read</b>s return strings. All <b>Write</b>s expect strings
or nil as parameter. If nil is passed to <b>Write</b>, value or
section is removed. All Dirs return list of strings.<br />
In write, only strings can be section names and only strings or
integers may be values. Integers are converted to strings when
writting and are read back as strings.<br />
If <b>Write</b> is requested to write (create) key or section on
non-existing path, the sections on path are created (like in
recursive mkdir). <br />
 
<p>With the <b>repeat_names</b> option, a list of values is
returned/expected for a given key where a single value would be
returned/expected without the option. That is also true if there is
only one such key or none.<br />
Deleting only one instance of many values/sections with the same
name is not possible. All of them are deleted by <tt>Write
(.ini.value|section.<i>foo</i>.<i>bar</i>, nil)</tt></p>

<h4 id="all">All-at-once Read/Write</h4>

<tt>Read (.ini.all.<i>sectionname</i>.<i>sectionname</i>)</tt> or
simply <tt>Read (.ini.all)</tt> returns a map as follows: 
<pre>
    $[
      "kind": "section",
      "name": "Foo",
      "type": 1,                        /* section_type */
      "file": -1,                       /* "rewrite", section_file */
      "comment": "huhly",
      "value": [ /*recursion*/ ],
    ],
</pre>

where the <tt>"value"</tt> list contains maps describing
subsections (see above) or values: 
<pre>
    $[
      "kind": "value",
      "name": "Foo",
      "type": 0,                        /* value_type */
      "comment": "blah",
      "value": "Bar",
    ],
</pre>

<tt>Write (.ini.all.<i>section1</i>.<i>section2</i>,
<i>new_section2_map</i>)</tt> replaces section2 with new_section2.
<tt>Write (.ini.all, <i>new_map</i>)</tt> replaces all the data. 
<p>Multiple names of the same kind are allowed.</p>

<p>With <a href="#multiple-files">multiple files</a>, files must
be erased explicitly by writing <tt>nil</tt> to the section
<tt>value</tt>. (Works since yast2-core-2.13.16.)</p>

<h3 id="flatmode">SysConfig/flat mode</h3>

<p>This mode is used for reading sysconfig-files and is compatibile
with rc-agent. So values are accessible under
<tt>.ini.<i>key</i></tt> and their comments are accessible under
<tt>.ini.<i>key</i>.comment</tt>. Value may be removed by storing
<tt>nil</tt> into it. If you specify unexisting key when writting
value, new value will be created. You may not create value by
writting its comment.</p>

<h3 id="finally">Writes are Cached</h3>

<p>Changes are written to disk when <tt>Write (.ini, nil)</tt> is called or
in agent destructor.<br />
Agent handles external change of ini file, in
other words, it writes only changed values (except when <a
href="#repeat_names">repeat_names</a> is used). If you do not call
Write at the end, agent writes changed data to disk in the
destructor.<br />
By default file is written only if something changed. File may be
forced to be written by calling <tt>Write (.ini,
"force");</tt><br />
If you do not want agent to write changed data, call <tt>Write
(.ini, "clean");</tt>. It will set dirty flag to false. Use with
care! It does not revert data to their original values! Most save
is using it just before leaving module (and destroying the
agent).<br />
When write is unable to open some file for writting, it returns
false. True is returned otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="TODOs">TODOs</h2>

I am going to implement following features when someone requests
them. I do not want to fill the agent with features that will be
never used.<br />
<h3 id="allowed">Allowed section names and key names</h3>

There can be list of allowed names for sections/keys. No problem to
implement, just tell if you need it. But do you really need it? 
<h3 id="browser">Browser</h3>

There could be some Read function that would return structure that
could be passed to tree widget. It is really the fastest way to
create it in C++ but I am not sure if it is possible to do it
enough versatile. Another problem is with changes. 
<h3 id="reorder">Re-ordering</h3>

We should be able to change order of values/sections. 
<h3 id="rename">Section renaming</h3>

We should be able to rename section. Easy to implement. Does
anybody need it? 
<h3 id="dontreread">I am the highest authority!</h3>

Client should be able to tell agent not to re-read externally
changed file. Sometimes, when client completly re-creates file, its
re-read could cause big mess. <br />
<br />
 
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

Each features should be tested in testsuite. Look for an
inspiration there. Here are some most common or interesting
examples:<br />
<h3 id="ex.providers">Dialup providers (package providers)</h3>
